0,nlp is a multidisciplinary field that draws from linguistics and computer science particularly artificial intelligence in terms of linguistics a program must be able to deal with words that have multiple meanings wind up the clock and the wind is cold today as well as grammatical ambiguities in the phrase little girl s school is it the school that is little the girls or both of course each language has its own forms of ambiguity programs can use several strategies for dealing with these problems including using statistical models to predict the likely meaning of a given phrase based on a corpus of existing text in that language as formidable as the task of extracting the correct literal meaning from text can be it is really only the first level of natural language processing if a program is to successfully summarize or draw conclusions about a news report from north korea for example it would also have to have a knowledge base of facts about that country and or a set of frames about how to interpret various situations such as threat bluff or compromise
0,there are a variety of emerging applications for nlp including the following voice controlled computer interfaces such as in aircraft cockpits programs that can assist with planning or other tasks more realistic interactions with computer controlled game characters robots that interact with humans in various settings such as hospitals automatic analysis or summarization of news stories and other text intelligence and surveillance applications analysis of communication etc data mining creating consumer profiles and other ecommerce applications search engine improvements such as in determining relevancy
0,as each new means of communication and social interaction is introduced social customs and etiquette evolve in response for example it took time before the practice of saying hello and identifying oneself became the universal way to initiate a phone conversation by the 1980s a system of topical news postings carried on the internet was becoming widely used in universities the computer industry and scientific institutions many new users did not understand the system and posted messages that were off topic others used their postings as to insult or attack flame other users particularly in newsgroups discussing perennially controversial topics such as abortion when a significant number of postings in a newsgroup are devoted to flaming and counter flaming many users who had sought civilized intelligent discussion leave in protest in 1984 chuq von rospach wrote a document entitled a primer on how to work with the usenet community it and later guides to net etiquette or netiquette offered useful guidelines to new users and to more experienced users who wanted to facilitate civil discourse
0,these suggestions include learn about the purpose of a newsgroup before you post to it if a group is moderated understand the moderator s guidelines so your postings won t be rejected before posting follow some discussions to see what sort of language tone and attitude seems to be appropriate for this group do not post bulky graphics or other attachments unless the group is designed for them avoid ad hominem to the person attacks when discussing disagreements do not post in all caps which is interpreted as shouting check your postings for proper spelling and grammar on the other hand avoid flaming other users for their spelling or grammar errors when replying to an existing message include enough of the original message to provide context for your reply but no more if you know the answer to a question or problem raised by another user send it to that user by e mail that way the newsgroup doesn t get cluttered up with dozens of versions of the same information
0,in recent years there has been growing concern that internet users may eventually be treated differently by service providers depending on the kind of data they download or the kind of application programs they use online advocates of network or net neutrality want legislation that would bar cable dsl or other providers from making such distinctions such as by charging content providers higher fees for high volumes of data or even blocking certain applications advocates of net neutrality believe that since there are rather limited choices for broadband internet service discrimination on the basis of web content could lead to a loss of freedom for consumers and providers alike
0,by the late 1970s researchers at many major universities were using the unix operating system in 1979 a suite of utilities called uucp was distributed with the widely used unix version 7 these utilities could be used to transfer files between unix computers that were linked by some form of telephone or network connection two duke university graduate students tom truscott and jim ellis decided to set up a way in which users on different computers could share a collection of files containing text messages on various topics they wrote a simple set of shell scripts that could be used for distributing and viewing these message files the first version of the news network linked computers at duke and at the university of north carolina soon these programs were revised and rewritten in the c language and distributed to other unix users as the a release of the news software during the 1980s the news system was expanded and features such as moderated newsgroups were added as the internet and its tcp ip protocol became a more widespread standard for connecting computers a version of news using the nntp network news transmission protocol over the internet was released in 1986 netnews is a mature system today with news reading software available for virtually every type of computer
0,netnews postings are simply text files that begin with a set of standard headers similar to those used in e mail like e mail news postings can have binary graphics or program files attached using a standard called mime for multipurpose internet mail extensions the files are stored on news servers machines that have the spare capacity to handle the hundreds of gigabytes of messages now posted each week the files are stored in a typical hierarchical unix fashion grouped into approximately 75 000 different newsgroups as shown in the following table the newsgroups are broken down into 10 major categories the names of individual groups begin with the major category and then specify subdivisions for example the newsgroup comp sys ibm pc deals with ibm pc compatible personal computers while comp os linux deals with the linux operating system
0,the servers are linked into a branching distribution system messages being posted by users are forwarded to the nearest major regional node site which in turn distributes them to other major nodes in turn when messages arrive at a major node from another region they are distributed to all the smaller sites that share the newsfeed due to the volume of groups and messages many sites now choose to receive only a subset of the total newsfeed sites also determine when messages will expire and thus be removed from the site there are dozens of different news reading programs that can be used to view the available newsgroups and postings on unix systems programs such as elm and tin are popular while other newsreaders cater to windows macintosh and other systems major web browsers such as netscape and internet explorer offer simplified news reading features to use these news readers the user accesses a newsfeed at an address provided by the internet service provider isp there are also services that let users simply navigate through the news system by following the links on a web page the former service called dejanews now google groups is the best known and most complete such site
0,in the 1940s the main objective in developing the first digital computers was to speed up the process of calculation in the 1950s the machines began to be used for more general data processing tasks by governments and business by the 1960s computers were in use in most major academic government and business organizations the desire for users to share data and to communicate both within and outside their organization led to efforts to link computers together into networks computer manufacturers began to develop proprietary networking software to link their computers but they were limited to a particular kind of computer such as a dec pdp minicomputer or an ibm mainframe however the u s defense department seeing the need for a robust decentralized network that could maintain links between their computers under wartime conditions funded the development of a protocol that given appropriate hardware to bridge the gap could link these disparate networks
0,according to the osi open systems interconnection model a network can be considered to be a series of seven layers laid one atop another the physical layer is at the bottom it specifies the physical connections between the computers which can be anything from ordinary phone lines to cable fiber optic or wireless this layer specifies the required electrical characteristics such as voltage changes and durations that constitute the physical signal that is recognized as either a 1 or 0 in the bit stream the next layer called the data link layer specifies how data will be grouped into chunks of bits frames or packets and how transmission errors will be dealt with the network layer groups the data frames as parts of a properly formed data packet and routes that packet from the sending node to the specified destination node a variety of routing algorithms can be used to determine the most efficient route given current traffic or line conditions the transport layer views the packets as part of a complete transmission of an object such as a web page and ensures that all the packets belonging to that object are sorted into their original sequence at the destination this is necessary because packets belonging to the same message may be sent via different routes in keeping with traffic or line conditions the session layer provides application programs communicating over the network with the ability to initiate terminate or restart an interrupted data transfer the presentation layer ensures that data formats are consistent so that all applications know what to expect this layer can also provide special services finally the application layer gives applications highlevel commands for performing tasks over the network such as file transfer protocol ftp
0,a network attached storage nas unit can be thought of as a dedicated data storage unit that is available to all users of a network unlike a traditional dedicated file storage unit a nas unit typically has an operating system and software designed specifically and only for providing data storage services the actual storage is usually provided by an array of hard drives files on the nas are accessed through protocols such as smb server message block common on windows networks and nfs network file system used on many unix and some linux networks in recent years smaller lower cost nas devices have become available for smaller networks including home networks where they can store music video and other files
0,although it sounds similar a storage area network san does not function as its own file server rather it attaches storage modules such as hard drives or tape libraries to an existing server so that it appears to the server s operating system as though it were locally attached typically the protocol used to attach the storage is scsi but the physical connection is fiber or high speed ethernet the emphasis for san applications is the need for fast access to data such as in large online databases e mail servers and high volume file servers sans offer great flexibility since storage can be expanded without changing the network structure and a replacement server can quickly be attached to the storage in case of hardware failure
0,in the kind of science fiction sometimes called cyberpunk people are able to jack in or connect their brains directly tocomputer networks because of this direct input into the brain or perhaps the optic and other sensory nerves a personwho is jacked in experiences the virtual world as fully real and can depending on the world s rules manipulate it withhis or her mind this kind of all immersive virtual reality isstill science fiction but today people are beginning to controlcomputers and artificial limbs directly with their minds
0,neuroprosthetics is the creation of artificial limbs or sensoryorgans that are directly connected to the nervous system the first and most widely used example is the cochlearimplant which can restore hearing by taking sound signals from a microphone and converting them to electricalimpulses that directly stimulate auditory nerves within thecochlea a part of the inner ear similarly experimental retinal implants that stimulate optic nerves are beginning tooffer crude but useful vision to certain blind patients research in connecting the brain to artificial arms orlegs is still in its early stages but scientists using microelectrode arrays have been able to record signals from thebrain s neurons and correlate them to different types ofmotor movements in a series of experiments at duke university researchers first trained a monkey to operate a joystick to move a shape in a video game they then recordedand analyzed the signals produced by the monkey s brainwhile playing the game and correlated them with themotor movements in the joystick next they replicatedthese movements with a robotic arm as the monkey movedthe joystick finally they were able to train the monkey tomove the robotic arm without using the joystick at all simply by thinking about the movements
0,as more is learned about the detailed functioning of neuronal networks inside the brain cognitive prosthetics maybecome feasible one example might be computer memory modules that might act as a surrogate or extension ofhuman memory perhaps helping compensate for loss ofmemory due to age or disease early experiments on interfacing to the hippocampus a part of the brain important forforming memories have been underway since 2003 other possibilities might include processors that couldgive a person the ability to think about a mathematicalproblem and see the answer or to search databases or theweb simply by visualizing or thinking about the information desired
0,integers whole numbers have the simplest representation but there are two important considerations the totalnumber of bits available and whether one bit is used to holdthe sign since all numbers are stored as binary digits an unsignedinteger has a range from 0 to 2bits where bits is the totalnumber of bits available thus if there are 16 bits available the maximum value for an integer is 65535 if negativenumbers are to be handled a signed integer must be used in most languages such as c c and java an integer issigned unless unsigned is specified since one bit is usedto hold the sign and each bit doubles the maximum size itfollows that a signed integer can have only half the rangeabove or below zero thus a 16 bit signed integer can rangefrom 32 768 to 32 767 one complication is that the available sizes of integersdepend on whether the computer system s native data sizeis 16 32 or 64 bits in most cases the native size is 32 bits so the declaration int in a c program on such a machineimplies a signed 32 bit integer that can range from 231 or 2 147 483 647 to 231 1 or 2 147 483 647 however if one isusing large numbers in a program it is important to checkthat the chosen type is large enough the long specifier isoften used to indicate an integer twice the normal size or64 bits in this case
0,numbers with a fractional decimal part are usually storedin a format called floating point the floating means thatthe location of the decimal point can be moved as necessaryto fit the number within the specified digit range a floatingpoint number is actually stored in four separate parts firstcomes the sign indicating whether the number is negativeor positive next comes the mantissa which contains theactual digits of the number both before and after the decimal point the radix is the base for the number systemused finally the exponent determines where the decimalpoint will be placed for example the base 10 number 247 35 could be represented as 24735 10 2 the 2 moves the decimal pointat the end two places to the left however floating pointnumbers are normalized to a form in which there is just onedigit to the left of the decimal point thus 247 35 wouldactually be written 2 4735 102 this system is also knownas scientific notation as noted earlier actual data storage in modern computers is always in binary but the same principle applies according to ieee standard 754 32 bit floating point numbers use 1 bit for the sign 8 bits for the exponent and 23bits for the mantissa also called the significand since itexpressed the digits that are significant that is guaranteed not to be lost through overflow or underflow in processing the double precision float declared as a double in c programs uses 1 11 and 52 bits respectively
0,many objects are more elaborate or specialized variations ofmore basic objects for example in microsoft windows thevarious kinds of dialog boxes are specialized versions of thegeneral window class therefore the specialized versionis created by declaring it to be derived from a base class put another way the specialized class inherits the basicdata and functions available in the base parent class theprogrammer can then add new data or functions or modifythe inherited ones to create the necessary behavior for thespecialized class languages such as c allow for a class to be derivedfrom more than one base class this is called multipleinheritance for example a message window class mightinherit its overall structure from the window class andits text display capabilities from the message class however it can sometimes be difficult to keep the relationshipsbetween multiple classes clear the java language takes thealternative approach of being limited to only single inheritance of classes but allowing interfaces specifications ofhow a class interacts with the program to be multiplyinherited
0,different kinds of objects often have analogous methods for example suppose there is a series of classes that represent various polygons square triangle hexagon and so forth each class has a method called perimeter thatreturns the total distance around the edges of the object ifeach of these classes is derived from a base polygon class each class inherits the base class s perimeter method andadapts it for its own use thus a square might calculateits perimeter simply by multiplying the length of a side byfour while the rectangle would have to add up differentsized pairs of sides and so on
0,in the late 1990s banner ads started to appear on websites and other forms of advertising soon followed companies rushed into the online world either with the belief thatit had unlimited potential for finding new customers or outof fear that the competition would get there first unfortunately it was hard to measure the actual effectiveness ofads and web sites such as for publications that lookedto third party advertising as a source of income found theoutlook bleak in the wake of the bursting of the dot combubble of the early 2000 decade only a few years later however advertisers using newbusiness models and targeting techniques have made onlineadvertising not only a viable business but a rapidly growing one according to the interactive advertsing bureau internet advertising revenue in the united states in 2007was 21 2 billion up 26 percent from 2005 the effects of the online advertising revolution are rippling outward impacting traditional advertising mediasuch as newspapers in particular see craigslist magazines and even television

0,the dark side of online advertising is found in programsthat are surreptitiously installed on users pcs and thendownload and display advertising from shady web operations while many users nowregularly run programs to block such malware even legitimate online advertising can irritate users particularlywhen ads are too prominent float over and block text orlurk behind the browser window modern web browsershave ad blocking features that work with varying degreesof effectiveness as with tv online advertisers increasinglyhave to cope with impatient users who do not have to lookat ads unless they actually want to advertisers can employ several strategies to keep userswilling to look at ads one is to make the ad unobtrusiveand brief and on the way to something the user reallywants to see in 2007 youtube began such advertising another is to provide free versions of software or servicesthat in exchange for being free require the user to put upwith some screen real estate being devoted to ads finally as with tv advertising can be woven into the content itself such as in online computer games a sensitive area is the attempt to balance advertisers desire to know as much as possible about consumers interestsand buying habits with the same consumers concern aboutprotecting their privacy

0,the large computers that first became available in the 1950s used line printers these devices have one hammer for each column of the output a rapidly moving band of type moves under the hammers each hammer strikes the band when the correct character passes by printing is therefore done line by line hence the name line printers were fast 600 lines per minute or more but like the mainframes they served they were bulky and expensive the typewriter offered another point of departure for designing printers a few early computers such as the binac an offshoot of eniac used typewriters rigged with magnetically controlled switches solenoids however a more natural fit was with the teletype invented early in the 20th century to print telegraph messages since the teletype is already designed to print from electrically transmitted character codes it was easy to rig up a circuit to translate the contents of computer data into appropriate codes for printing since the teletype could send as well as receive messages it was often used as a control terminal for computer operators or for time sharing computer users into the 1970s the daisy wheel printer was another typewriter like device it used a movable wheel with the letters embedded in slim petals hence the name it was slow about 10 characters a second noisy and expensive but it was the only affordable alternative for early personal computer users who required letter quality output
0,the dot matrix printer which came into common use in the 1980s uses a different principle of operation than typewriter style printers unlike the latter the dot matrix printer does not form solid characters instead it uses an array of magnetically controlled pins 9 pins at first but 24 on later models each character is formed by pressing the appropriate pins into a ribbon that pushes into the paper leaving a pattern of tiny dots besides being relatively inexpensive dot matrix printers are versatile in that a great variety of character styles or fonts can be printed either by loading different sets of bitmaps likewise graphic images can also be printed however because the characters are made of tiny dots they don t have the crisp solid look of printed type

0,the benefits of rfid technology are numerous better inventory control more secure passports and other forms of id faster easier access to transportation systems and potentially the avoidance of mishaps in hospitals such as the wrong patient receiving a drug or procedure however there are privacy and security concerns that remain to be fully resolved the primary threat is that unauthorized persons could illicitly obtain information or track people or goods for purposes ranging from simple larceny to identity theft privacy rights organizations have also raised concerns that information about consumer purchases could be used for unwanted marketing or sold to third parties while information about a library patron s reading habits could trigger unwarranted government investigations in the name of fighting terrorism there is an incentive to produce rfid cards and tags that are resistant to unauthorized reading or tampering a cryptographic protocol can be used such that no information will be sent or received unless the reader and tag know the correct keys another possibility is to create a device that can jam reading attempts in the device s vicinity perhaps protecting a customer s grocery cart from being scanned finally rfid cards can be put inside in a sleeve of material that blocks the signals however cryptographic and other security technologies raise the cost of rfid devices and may make them impracticable for some applications in september 2006 the national science foundation awarded a 1 1 million grant to the rfid consortium for security and privacy to study potential risks and safeguards for the technology that same year a group of major corporations together with the national consumers league released a draft set of standards and guidelines for best practices in using rfid with broader scope than the existing epc electronic product code standard

0,in 1921 the czech playwright karel capek wrote a play called r u r or rossum s universal robots robot is a czech word that has been translated as work er serf or slave in the play the robots which are built by factories to work in other factories eventually revolt against their human masters during the 1960s real robots began to appear in factory settings they were an outgrowth of earlier machine tools that had been programmed by cams and other mechanisms an industrial robot is basically a movable arm that ends in a hand called an end effector the arm and hand can be moved by some combination of hydraulic pneumatic electrical or mechanical means typical applications include assembling parts welding and painting the robot is programmed for a task either by giving it a detailed set of commands to move to grasp and manipulate objects or by training the robot by moving its arm hand and effectors through the required motions which are then stored in the robot s memory by the early 1970s unimation inc had created a profitable business from selling its unimate robots to factories the early industrial robots had very little ability to respond to variations in the environment such as the work piece that the robot was supposed to grasp being slightly out of position however later models have more sophisticated sensors to enable them to adjust to variations and still accomplish the task the more sophisticated computer programs that control newer robots have internal representations or frames of reference to keep track of both the robot s internal parameters angles pressures and so on and external locations in the work area
0,industrial robots work in an extremely restricted environment so their world representation can be quite simple however robots that can move about in the environment have also been developed military programs have developed automatic guided vehicles agvs with wheels or tracks capable of navigating a battlefield and scouting or attacking the enemy space going robots including the sojourner mars rover also have considerable onboard intelligence although their overall tasks are programmed by remote commands indeed the extent to which mobile robots are truly autonomous varies considerably at one end is the robot that is steered and otherwise controlled by its human operator such as law enforcement robots that can be sent into dangerous hostage situations another example is the robots that fight in arena combat in the popular robot warsshows
0,moving toward greater autonomy we have the service robots that have begun to show up in some institutions such as hospitals and laboratories these mobile robots are often used to deliver supplies for example the helpmate robot can travel around a hospital by itself navigating using an internal map it can even take an elevator to go to another floor service robots have had only modest market penetration however they are relatively expensive and limited in function and if relatively low wage more versatile human labor is available it is generally preferred for now mobile robots and service robots are most likely to turn up in specialized applications in environments too dangerous for human workers such as in the military law enforcement handling of hazardous materials and so on
0,ibm did succeed in creating rpg report program generator a language designed to make it easier for programmers including beginners to generate business reports most cobol programs read data perform tests and calculations and print the results rpg first released in 1964 for use with the new system 360 mainframe and the smaller system 3 simplifies this process and eliminates most writing of program code statements a classic rpg program is built around the rpgcycle consisting of three stages during the input stage the input device s file type access specifications and data record structure are specified these specifications can be quite elaborate the heart of the program specifies calculations to be performed with the various data fields while the output section specifies how the results will be laid out in report form including such things as headers footers and sections subsequent versions of rpg added more features rpgiv released in 1994 includes the ability to define subroutines for example ibm has also released visualage rpg which allows for the creation and running of rpg programs in the microsoft windows environment there are also tools for interfacing rpg programs with various database systems and to use rpg for writing web based cgi programs
0,web sites such as news providers and blogs are constantly posting new material while readers can periodically visit a site to look for new material an increasingly popular option is to subscribe to a web feed and receive the latest information automatically the most commonly used tool for web feeds is rss which can stand for really simple syndication rich site summary or rdf site summary depending on the format used the data in an rss feed can include article titles summaries excerpts such as the first paragraph or the complete article or posting feeds can also include multimedia such as graphics video or sound the data and any linked material is formatted using standard markup elements as part of the process of setting up a feed on the web server the feed is published so that it can be found and read using a client program called a reader or aggregator the latter can combine feeds or organize them in a newspaper like format for convenience rss readers can be stand alone applications or be included with many modern web browsers and e mail clients alternatively webbased readers or aggregators such as newsgator online can allow feeds to be read using any web browser readers of web pages can find rss feeds by looking for a subscribe icon or the words rss or xml specialized search engines such as bloglines can also help users find interesting feeds additionally information on the server can also be used by software to automatically deliver the latest content
0,forerunners of rss go back to the mid 1990s with rdf site summary first appearing in 1999 for use on netscape s portal the adoption of rss by the new york times in 2002 greatly aided the popularization of the format as did the growing number of blogs that needed a way for contributors and readers to keep in touch today web browsers such as internet explorer mozilla firefox and safari support rss file sharing services such as bittorrent can be combined with rss to deliver content automatically to users hard drives an offshoot of rss called atom has been less widely adopted but offers better compatibility with xml standards and better management of multimedia content
0,rich text format was developed in the later 1980s by programmers at microsoft its purpose is to allow for interchange of documents between microsoft word and other software while preserving the original formatting an rtf file is itself a plain text file containing the document text enclosed in control codes that determine the formatting although rtf is an 8 bit format special escape sequences can be used to specify 16 bit unicode characters such as for non roman alphabets libraries and utilities are available for reading and writing rtf from most popular programming languages including perl php and ruby in practice rtf created by word processors tends to contain many control codes needed to ensure compatibility with older programs making the files bulky and not practicable to edit directly however saving a file in rtf is a good way to ensure that a document can be used by recipients who may have for example older versions of word
0,ruby is a versatile yet consistent programming language that has become popular in recent years particularly for web development designed by yukihiro matsumoto and first released in 1995 ruby has a compact syntax familiar to many users of perl and other scripting languages avoiding for example the need to declare variable types however ruby is also a thoroughgoing object oriented language somewhat like smalltalk matsumoto has stressed that the design of the language is intended to stress being natural and enjoyable for the programmer rather than focusing on the needs of the machine
0,the most popular programming environment for ruby is ruby on rails an open source application framework aimed particularly at writing programs that connect web sites to databases the framework is based on the model view controller approach separating data access and logic from the user interface and includes scaffolding that can be quickly filled in to provide data driven web sites with basic functionality developers can also create plug ins to extend the built in packages

0,sap specializes in enterprise resource planning erp enhancing a corporation s ability to manage its key assets and needs and to plan for the future this software consists of three tiers the database an application server and the client early versions of this software were designed to run on mainframes other major products include sap netweaver which integrates all other sap modules using modern open standard web technologies customer relationship manager supply chain management supplier relationship management human resource management system product lifestyle managementexchange infrastructure enterprise portal sap knowledge warehouse
0,sap has recognized for some time that while its base of large fortune 500 companies has given it steady income changing trends in business have been limiting the software giant s growth in particular the trend has been toward smaller simpler more scalable applications that can be integrated with modern web services in september 2007 sap announced sap business bydesign a flexible set of enterprise management services that are delivered over the web however it remains to be seen how well sap will be able to compete with more agile companies such as netsuite and salesforce com and whether the company will be able to upgrade its existing large company user base without disaffecting it sap s major competitor in the united states is oracle which has sued sap in 2007 for unfairly downloading and using patches and support materials from oracle and using them to support former oracle customers sap and oracle have generally had quite different growth strategies sap grows by expanding and extending its own products while oracle has grown mainly through acquiring other companies however in october 2007 sap acquired business objects a leader in business intelligence systems for 6 8 billion this may signal sap s willingness to engage in further strategic acquisitions
0,in order for a computer to work with information the information must be digitized converted to data that application programs can recognize and manipulate computer users have thus been confronted with the task of converting millions of pages of printed words or graphics into machine readable form since it is expensive to re key text and impractical to redraw images some way is needed to automatically convert the varying shades or colors of the text or images into a digitized graphics image that can be stored in a file this is what a scanner does the scanner head contains a charge coupled device ccd like that used in digital cameras the ccd contains thousands or millions of tiny regions that can convert incoming light into a voltage level each of these voltage levels when amplified will correspond to one pixel of the scanned image a color scanner uses three different diodes for each pixel each receiving light through a red green or blue filter
0,the operation of the head depends on the type of scanner in the most common type the flatbed scanner a motor moves the head back and forth across the paper which lies facedown on a glass window in a sheet fed scanner the head remains stationery and the paper is fed past it by a set of rollers finally there are handheld scanners where the job of moving the scanner head is performed by the user moving the scanner back and forth over the page
0,the resolution of a scanner depends on the number of pixels into which it can break the image the color depth depends on how many bits of information that it can store per pixel more information means more gradations of color or gray resolutions of 2 400 dots per inch dpi or more are now common with up to 36 bit color depth allowing for about 68 7 billion colors or gradations besides considerations of resolution and color depth the quality of a scanned image depends on the quality of the scanner s optics as well as on how the page or other object reflects light as anyone who has browsed ebay listings knows the quality of scans can vary considerably most scanners come with software that allows for the scanner to be controlled and adjusted from the pc and image editing software can be used to further adjust the scanned image
0,these general principles also apply to systems where more than one processor is available but there is the added complication of deciding where the scheduling program will be run in a multiprocessing system that has one master and many slave processors the scheduling program runs on the master processor this arrangement is simple but it means that when a slave processor wants to schedule a program it must wait until the scheduling program gets its next time slice on the master processor one alternative is to allow any processor that has free time to run the scheduling algorithm this is harder to set up because it requires a mechanism to make sure two processors do not try to run the scheduling program at the same time but it smoothes out the bottleneck that would arise from relying on a single processor
0,o trends in recent years have changed the emphasis in scheduling algorithms one is the continuing drop in price per unit of processing power and memory this means that maximum efficiency in using the hardware can often give way in favor of catering to the user s convenience and perceptions by giving more priority to interaction with the user the other development is the growing use of systems where much of the burden of graphics and interactivity is placed on the user s desktop thus simplifying the complexity of sch
0,from microbiology to plasma physics modern science would be impossible without the computer this is not because the computer has replaced the scientific method of observation hypothesis and experiment modern scientists essentially follow the same intellectual procedures at did galileo newton darwin and einstein rather understanding of the layered systems that make up the universe has now reached so complex and detailed a level that there is too much data for an individual human mind to grasp further the calculations necessary to process the data usually can t be performed by unaided humans in any reasonable length of time this can be caused either by the inherent complexity of the calculation or the sheer amount of data as in dna sequencing see bioinformatics and data mining
0,even if scientists have a basic understanding of a system it may be hard to determine what the overall results of the interaction of the many particles or other elements in the system will be this is true for example in the analysis of events taking place in nuclear reactors fortunately computers can apply the laws of the system to each of many particles and determine the resulting actions from their aggregate behavior simulation is particularly important in fields where actual experiments are not possible because of distance or time thus a hypothesis about the formation of the universe can be tested by applying it to a set of initial conditions believed to reflect those at or near the time of the big bang however even the most skilled scientists have trouble relating numbers to the shape and interaction of real world objects computers have greatly aided in making it possible to visualize structures and phenomena using high resolution 3d color graphics features of interest can be enhanced and arbitrary false colors can be used to visually show such things as temperature or blood flow these techniques can also be used to create interactive models where scientists can for example combine molecules in new ways and have the computer calculate the likely properties of the result finally computer visualization and modeling can be used both to teach science and to give the general public some visceral grasp of the meaning of scientific theories and discoveries
0,by the mid 1990s many thousands of pages were being added to the world wide web each day the availability of graphical browsing programs such as mosaic netscape and microsoft internet explorer made it easy for ordinary pc users to view web pages and to navigate from one page to another however people who wanted to use the web for any sort of systematic research found they needed better tools for finding the desired information there are basically three approaches to exploring the web casual surfing portals and search engines a user might find or hear about an interesting web page devoted to a business or other organization or perhaps a particular topic the page includes a number of featured links to other pages the user can follow any of those links to reach other pages that might be relevant those pages are likely to have other interesting links that can be followed and so on most web users have surfed in this way it can be fun and it can certainly lead to finds that can be bookmarked for later reference however this approach is not systematic comprehensive or efficient alternatively the user can visit a site such as the famous yahoo started by jerry yang and david filo these sites specialize in selecting what their editors believe to be the best and most useful sites for each topic and organizing them into a multilevel topical index the portal approach has several advantages the work of sifting through the web has already been done the index is easy to use and the sites featured are likely to be of good quality however even yahoo s busy staff can examine only a tiny portion of the estimated 1 trillion or so web pages being presented on about 175 million different web sites as of 2008 also the sites selected and featured by portals are subject both to editorial discretion or bias and in some cases to commercial interest
0,the ever growing world wide web consists of billions of linked html documents and other resources but most of the links contain no information about why the linkage has been made or what it might mean services such as google can automatically trace the links and index each page with the aid of metadata such as keywords that summarize page content however discovering the relationships between data items on pages or between pages and their meaning or semantics requires human scrutiny in his 1999 book weaving the web world wide web creator tim berners lee described a new way in which web pages might be organized in the future i have a dream for the web in which computers become capable of analyzing all the data on the web the content links and transactions between people and computers a semantic web which should make this possible has yet to emerge but when it does the day to day mechanisms of trade bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines the intelligent agents people have touted for ages will finally materialize in other words by encoding definitions of objects and their relationships into the text of web pages programs can be written to use this information to answer sophisticated questions such as which devices from this vendor use open source software
0,the semantic web is not something that can appear overnight after all it will take considerable human effort to encode the information needed for machines to understand web resources and additional effort to code the application programs that will take advantage of that information however the potential payoff is huge allowing both human and automated searchers to tackle much more sophisticated tasks for example the university of maryland is developing a prototype semantic search engine called swoogle it can extract information and determine relationships between documents that include rdf or owl elements swoogle can also help users find appropriate ontologies for exploring a subject much research needs to be done for example there is the problem of deriving a measure of reliability or trust based on the data sources used to answer the query which may be scattered all over the world and represent very different kind
0,a growing number of people 50 and older have been learning how to use computer technology and especially applications such as e mail and web browsing however a substantial number of seniors have expressed reluctance to join the digital world as of january 2006 the pew internet american life project found that only 34 percent of persons 65 and over were online some reasons why seniors have avoided the technology include the following the belief that it would be too hard to learn to use it uncertainty about what can be done online and whether it is worth the effort fear of well publicized dangers such as viruses and identity theft the expense of a personal computer and internet accessfortunately a number of these factors are gradually being ameliorated there are numerous books and courses such as at adult education or senior centers that introduce the essentials of computing to seniors properly installed security and filtering software together with some user education can minimize the chances of being victimized online finally internet capable pcs are now available for around 300 or less though the cost of broadband access has not fallen as rapidly as that of hardware
0,there are basically two ways to move data from a computer to or from a peripheral device such as a printer or modem a byte 8 bits of data can be moved all at once with each bit traveling along its own wire alternatively a single wire can be used to carry the data one bit at a time such a connection is called a serial port the serial port receives data a full byte at a time from the computer bus and uses a uart universal asynchronous receiver transmitter to extract the bits one at a time and send them through the port a corresponding circuit at the other end accumulates the incoming bits and reassembles them into data bytes the data bits for each byte are preceded by a start bit to signal the beginning of the data and terminated by an stopbit depending on the application an additional bit may be used for parity devices connected by a serial port must negotiate by requesting a particular connection speed and parity setting failure to agree results in gibberish being received
0,the official standard for serial transmission is called rs232c it defines various additional pins to which wires are connected such as for synchronization specifying when the device is ready to send or receive data and ground physically the old style connectors are called db 25 because they contain 25 pins many of which are not used most newer pcs have db 9 i e nine pin connectors a gender changer can be used in cases where two devices both have male connectors with pins or female connectors with corresponding sockets because they use a single data transmission line and include error correction serial cables can be longer than parallel cables 25 feet or more as opposed to 10 12 feet serial transmission is generally slower at up to 115 200 bits second than parallel transmission serial connections have generally been used for such devices as modems whose speed is already limited by phone line characteristics keyboards mice and some older printers today the faster and more flexible usb is replacing serial connections for many devices including even keyboards
0,in 1982 andrew fuegelman created a program called pc talk this program provided a better way for users with modems to connect to the many bulletin board systems that were starting to spring up fluegelman was familiar with the common practice of public radio and tv broadcasters of soliciting pledge payments to help support their free service he decided to do something similar with his program he distributed it to many bulletin boards where users could download it for free however he asked users who liked the program and wanted to continue to use it to pay him 25 fluegelman dubbed his method of software distribution freeware because it cost nothing to try out the program other programmers began to use the same method with their own software this included jim knopf author of the pc file database program and bob wallace who offered pc write as a full featured alternative to expensive commercial word processing program because fluegelman had trademarked the term freeware these other authors began to call their offerings shareware today freeware means software that can be downloaded at no cost and for which there is no charge for continued use the program may be redistributed by users as long as they don t charge for it
0,to see a simple shell in action a windows user need only bring up a command prompt type the word dir and press enter a shell called command com provides the user interface for users of ibm pc compatible systems running ms dos the command processor displays a prompt on the screen it then interprets the user s commands if the command involves one of the shell s internal operations such as dir to list a file directory it simply executes that routine for example the command dir temp pwould be interpreted as a call to execute the dir function passing it the name temp a directory and the p which dir interprets as a switch or instruction telling it to pause the directory listing after each screenful of text if the command is an external ms dos utility such as xcopy a file copying program the shell runs that program passing it the information mainly file names from the command line finally the shell can run any other executable program on the system it is then that program s responsibility to interpret and act upon any additional information that was provided ms dos also has the ability for the command com shell to read a series of commands stored in a text file called a batch file and having the bat batch extension this allowed for rudimentary scripting of system housekeeping operations or other routine tasks
0,a simulation is a simplified but adequate model that represents how a system works the system can be an existing real world one such as a stock market or a human heart or a proposed design for a system such as a new factory or even a space colony if a system is simple enough a cannonball falling from a height for example it is possible to use formulas such as those provided by newton to get an exact answer however many real world systems involve many discrete entities with complex interactions that cannot be captured with a single equation during the 1940s scientists encountered just this problem in attempting to understand what would happen under various conditions in a nuclear reaction together with physicist enrico fermi two mathematicians john von neumann and stanislaw ulam devised a new way to simulate complex systems instead of trying fruitlessly to come up with some huge formula to solve the whole system they applied probability formulas to each of a number of particles in effect rolling the dice for each one and then observing their resulting distribution and behavior because of its analogy to gambling this became known as the monte carlo method it turned out to be widely useful not only for simulating nuclear reactions and particle physics but for many other activities such as bombing raids or the spread of disease where many separate things behave according to probabilities
0,simulations and simulation techniques are used for a tremendous range of applications today besides helping with the understanding of natural systems in physics chemistry biology or engineering simulation techniques are also applied to human behavior for example the behavior of consumers or traders in a stock market can be explored with a simulation based on game theory concepts artificial intelligence techniques such as expert systems can be used to give the individual actors in a simulation more realistic behavior simulations are often used in training a modern flight simulator for example not only simulates the aerodynamics of a plane and its response to the environment and to control inputs but detailed graphics and simulated physical motion can make such training simulations feel very realistic if not quite to star trek holodeck standards whether for flight military exercises or stock trading simulations can provide a much wider range of experiences in a relatively short time than would be feasible or safe using the real world activity simulations can also play an important part in testing software or systems or in predicating the results of business decisions or strategies simulations are also frequently sold as entertainment many commercial strategy and role playing games as well as vehicle simulators contain surprisingly complex simulations that make the games both absorbing and challenging such games can also have considerable educational value

0,the simplest and least efficient kind of sort is called the selection sort rather like a bridge player organizing a hand the selection sort involves finding the record with the lowest key and swapping it with the first record then scanning back through for the next lowest key and swapping it with the second record and so on until all the records are sorted while this uses memory very efficiently since the records are sorted in place it is not only slow but also gets worse fast that is the time taken to sort n records is proportional to n2 the selection approach suffers because on each pass the sort determines not only the record with the lowest key but 446 sorting and searchingthe one with the next lowest key however that information is not retained the heapsort invented by john williams in 1964 uses a binary tree to store a heap of sorted records once the heap is built the tree nodes can be used to store record numbers in a corresponding array that will represent the sorted database the heapsort is efficient because no records are physically moved and the only memory needed is for the heap and array the heapsort is generally considered the fastest and most reliable general purpose sorting algorithm with a maximum running time of log n
0,the bubble sort is based on making comparisons and swaps it makes the most convenient comparison possible each record with its neighbor the algorithm looks at the first two records if the second has a lower key than the first the records are swapped the procedure continues with the second and third records then the third and fourth and so on through all the records swapping pairs of adjacent records whenever they are out of order after one pass the record with highest key will have bubbled up to the end of the list the procedure is then repeated for all but the last record until the two highest records are at the end and so on until all the records are sorted unfortunately the number of comparisons and swaps that must be made makes the bubble sort as slow as the selection sort
0,the quicksort improves on the basic bubble sort by first choosing a record with a key approximately midway between the lowest and highest this key is called the pivot the records are then moved to the left of the pivot if they are lower than it and to the right if higher that is the records are divided into two partitions the process is then repeated to split the left side with a new pivot and then the right side likewise this is continued until the partition size is one and the records are now all sorted because of this repeated partitioning quicksort is usually implemented using a procedure that calls itself repeatedly see recursion devised by c a r hoare in 1962 quicksort is much faster than the bubble sort because records are moved over greater distances in a single operation rather than simply being exchanged with their neighbors assuming an appropriate initial pivot value is chosen running time is proportional to the logarithm of n rather than to the square of n the difference becomes dramatic as the size of the database increases
0,the bubble sort and quicksort are designed to work with records that are in random order however in many applications a database grows slowly over time at any given time the existing database is already sorted so it hardly makes sense to have to resort the whole database each time a new record is added instead an insertion sort can be used in its simplest form the algorithm looks sequentially through the sorted records until it finds the first record whose key is higher than that of the new record the new record can then be inserted just before that record much like the way a bridge player might organize the cards in a hand since inserting a record and physically moving all the higher records up in memory can be time consuming a linked list of key values and associated record number is often used instead see list processing that way only the links need to be changed rather than any records being moved the insertion sort was improved by donald l shell in 1959 his shellsort takes a recursive approach like that in the quicksort and applies the insertion sort procedure to successively smaller partitions another improvement on the insertion sort is the mergesort as the name implies this approach begins by creating two small lists of sorted records using a simple comparison algorithm then merging the lists into longer lists merging is accomplished by looking at the two keys on the top of two lists and taking whichever is lowest until the lists are exhausted the merge sort also lends itself to a recursive approach and it is comparable in speed and stability to the heapsort
0,all of the sorting algorithms discussed so far rely upon some form of comparison however it also possible to sort records by calculating their relative positions or distribution in its simplest form an array can be created whose range of indexes is equal to 1 to the maximum possible key value each key is then stored in the index position equal to its value that is a record with a key of 2314 would be stored in the array at position array 2314 this procedure works well but only if the keys are all integers the range is small enough to fit in memory and there are no duplicate keys since a duplicate would in effect overwrite the record already stored in that position a more practical approach is to use a formula hash function that should create a unique hash value for each key the function must be chosen to minimize collisions where two keys end up with the same hash value which creates the same problem as with duplicate keys a hash sort is quite efficient within those constraints
0,there are a number of ways that sound can be sampled stored or generated digitally here we will look at some of the most popular sound file formats wavthe wav wave file format is specific to microsoft windows it essentially stores the raw sample data that represents the digitized audio content including information about the sampling rate which in turns affects the sound quality since wav files are not compressed they can consume considerable disk space aiffaiff stands for audio interchange file format and is specific to the apple macintosh and to silicon graphics sgi platforms like wav it stores actual sound sample data a variant aiff c can store compressed sound authe au audio file format was developed by sun microsystems and is used mainly on unix systems and also in java programming midimidi stands for musical instrument digital interface unlike most other sound formats midi files don t represent sampled sound data rather they represent virtual musical instruments that synthesize sound according to complex algorithms that attempt to mirror the acoustic characteristics of real pianos guitars or other instruments since midi is like a score for the virtual instruments rather than storing the sounds it is much more compact than sampled sound formats midi is generally used for music composition rather than casual listening mp3mp3 is actually a component of the mpeg moving picture expert group multimedia standard and stands for mpeg1 audio layer 3 it is now the most popular sound format using compression to provide a balance of sound quality
0,while spam can appear in any communications medium including chat instant messaging and even blogs the most prevalent type is e mail spam which costs u s businesses billions of dollars a year in processing expenditures lost time and damage caused by malicious software malware for which spam can be either a delivery vehicle or an inducement in 2007 an estimated 90 billion spam messages were sent each day the fundamental driving force of spam is the fact that given one has internet access sending e mail costs essentially nothing no matter how many messages are sent thus even if only a tiny number of people respond to a spam solicitation such as for sexual enhancement products the result is almost pure profit for the spammer besides directly making fraudulent solicitations for products that are ineffective counterfeit or nonexistent spam carries two other dangers inducements to click to visit fake web sites and attachments containing viruses or other dangerous software
0,ways to stop the spread of spam include the following e mail filtering software using a combination of text analysis by keyword or statistical correlation and lists of internet locations domains associated with spamming filtering can be done both by service providers and individual users or collaboratively tightening the technical requirements for messages to be accepted by mail servers much spam has poorly formatted headers improving techniques for blocking the viruses used by spammers to set up their bots see computervirus and firewall attempting to shut down the infrastructure that supports spam operations such as hosts who allow e mail and sellers of spamming software and illicitly gathered address lists
0,spyware and adware are two pervasive threats to computer users both are programs that are installed more or less surreptitiously often accompanying an attractive looking free software package or media download depending on how widely it is defined as many as eight out of 10 pcs may be infected by some sort of spyware signs of infection can include the system slowing down or periodically freezing web browsers that fail to display the expected home page or search results and the appearance of numerous unwanted pop up windows a sign of adware ranging from least to most harmful spyware and adware can do the following display annoying advertising that can clog up the screen or cover up information some adware can also be spyware that uses information about the user to target advertising track web browsing to provide information to sell to marketers obtain personal information for use in identity theft install keyloggers programs that record keystrokes such as passwords being entered or other back door or trojan programs
0,growing concern about spyware has prompted the use of antispyware programs such as ad aware and spybot search destroy as well as a free program from microsoft antispyware programs are also being included in popular security suites from companies such as symantec and mcafee the programs work similarly to antivirus programs watching for suspicious behavior or signatures matching known spyware or adware depending on the program the spyware can be blocked from executing at all or removed from the system the software varies considerably in effectiveness so users may have to run several different programs to completely remove an infestation spyware has been generally given a lower priority than viruses or even spam when challenged spyware makers generally claim that the user authorized its installation at least implicitly by installing the utility or other software that contains it although antispyware legislation has been introduced in congress it has not passed as of mid 2008 however state officials such as former new york state attorney general eliot spitzer successfully sued a spyware company winning a 7 5 million settlement
0,a stack is simply a list that represents successive locations in memory into which data can be inserted the operation of a stack can be visualized as being rather like the springloaded platform onto which dishes are stacked for washing in some restaurants as each dish number is added the stack is pushed because only the item on top the last one added can be removed popped at any given time a stack is described as a lifo last in first out structure note that this is different from a queue where items can be added or removed from either end see queue stacks are useful whenever nested items must be tracked for example a procedure might call a procedure that in turn calls another procedure the stack can keep track of the parameters as well as the calling address for each pending procedure stacks can also be used to evaluate nested arithmetic expressions
0,web users increasingly have access to such content as news broadcasts songs and even full length videos the problem is that the user must receive the content in real time at a steady pace not in sputters or jerks however factors such as load on the web server and network congestion between the server and user can cause delays in transmission one way to reduce the problem would be to compress the data however excessive compression would compromise audio or picture quality to an unacceptable extent fortunately a technology called streaming offers a way to smooth out the transmission of large amounts audio or video content when a user clicks on an audio or video link the player software or web browser plug in is loaded and the transmission begins typically the player stores a few seconds of the transmission so any momentary delays in the transmission of data packets will not appear as the data starts to play assuming the rate of transmission remains sufficient enough data remains in the buffer so that data can be fed to the playing software at a steady pace if however there is too much delay due to network congestion the playback will pause while the player refills its buffer

0,anyone who has seen computers in old movies is familiar with the row of large freestanding tape cabinets with their spinning reels of tape the visual cue that the computer was running consisted of the reels thrashing back and forth vigorously while rows of lights flashed on the computer console magnetic tape was indeed the mainstay for data storage in most large computers in the 1950s through the 1970s in early mainframes the main memory corresponding to today s ram chips consisted of core thousands of tiny magnetized rings crisscrossed with wires by which they could be set or read because core memory was limited to a few thousand bytes kb it was used only to hold the program instructions and to store temporary working data while the program was running the source data to be processed by the program was read from a reel of tape on the drive if the program updated the data rather than just reporting on it it would generally write a new tape with the revised data in large facilities a person called a tape librarian was in charge of keeping the reels of tape organized and providing them to the computer operators as needed
0,by the 1990s pc users generally used tapes only for making backups a typical backup tape drive uses dat digital audio tape cartridges that hold from hundreds of megabytes to several gigabytes of data most drives use a rotating assembly of four heads two read and two write that verify data as it s being written as a backup medium tape has a lower cost per gigabyte than disk devices it is easy to use and can be set up to run unattended except for periodically changing cartridges however since tapes are written and read sequentially they are not convenient for restoring selected files many smaller installations now prefer using a second mirror hard drive as backup using disk arrays or using recordable cds or optical drives for smaller amounts of data many large companies and government agencies have thousands of reels of tape stored away in their vaults since the 1960s including data returned from early nasa space missions as time passes it becomes increasingly difficult to guarantee that this archived data can be successfully read this is due both to gradual deterioration of the medium and the older data formats becoming obsolete

0,as the name implies a touchscreen is a screen display that can respond to various areas being touched or pressed invented in 1971 the first form of touchscreens to become part of daily life were found on automatic teller machines atms and point of sale credit card processors touchscreens can detect the pressure of a finger or stylus in several ways a resistive touchscreen uses two layers of electrically conductive metallic material separated by a space when an area is touched the two layers are electrically connected and the change in electrical current is registered and converted to a code that identifies the location touched surface acoustic wave saw touchscreens use an ultrasonic wave that is interrupted by a touch capacitive touchscreens respond to the change in electron storage capacitance caused by contact with a human body various other acoustic mechanical strain based or optical systems can also be used with the latter being particularly popular
0,many computer applications involve the arrival of a set of data that must be processed in a specified way for example a bank s atm system receives a customer s request to deposit money together with identification of the account and the amount to be deposited the system must accept the deposit update the account balance and return a receipt to the customer this is an example of real time transaction processing some applications process transactions in batches for example a company may run a program once a month that generates paychecks and withholding stubs from employee records that include hours worked number of dependents claimed and so on indeed in the atm example the account balance is typically not updated during the on line transaction but instead a batch transaction is stored overnight that transaction will be processed together with other transactions affecting that account such as checks and the balance will then be officially updated the program module that keeps track of the progress of transactions is called a transaction monitor
0,the tree is a data structure that consists of individual intersections called nodes the tree normally starts with a single root node unlike real trees data trees have their root at the top and branch downward the root connects to one or more nodes which in turn branch into additional nodes often through a number of levels a node that branches downward from another node is called that node s childnode a node at the bottom that does not branch any further is called a terminal node or sometimes a leaf trees are useful for expressing many sorts of hierarchical structures such as file systems where the root of a disk holds folders that in turn can hold files or additional folders and so on down many levels a corporate organization chart is a noncomputer example of a hierarchical tree
0,a binary tree is a tree in which no node has more than two child nodes to move through data stored in a binary tree a program can use two pointers one to the current node s left child and one to its right child the pointers can then be used to trace the paths through the nodes if the tree represents a file that has been sorted comparing nodes to the desired value and branching accordingly quickly leads to the desired record alternatively the data can be stored directly in contiguous memory locations corresponding to the successive numbers of the nodes this method is faster than having to trace through successive pointers and a binary search algorithm can be applied directly to the stored data on the other hand it is easier to insert new items into a linked list a common solution is to combine the two structures storing the linked list in a contiguous range of memory by storing its root in the middle of the range its left child at the beginning of the range its right child at the end and then repeatedly splitting each portion of the range to store each level of children intuitively one can see that algorithms for processing such stored trees will take a recursive approach
0,the more than five century old art of typography the design arrangement and setting of printing type was transformed in the latter part of the 20th century by digital technology with the exception of some traditional presses devoted to the fine book market nearly all type used today is designed and set by computer most users are familiar with the typefaces distributed with their operating system and software such as the popular adobe and truetype many such font designs are based on and sometimes named after traditional typefaces modified for readability using typical displays and printers for control of composition there are three overlapping levels of software ranging from easiest to use but most limited to most complex versatile and precise modern word processors such as microsoft word and open office provide enough control for many types of shorter documents desktop publishing software adds facilities suitable for layout of fliers brochures newsletters and similar publications that often mix text and graphics more elaborate documents such as books magazines and newspapers require more sophisticated facilities to control the layout and flow of text some traditional choices include latex for the tex typesetting program used particularly by scientists and other academics and the older troff and its offshoots on unix systems more recent programs include quark framemaker pagemaker and indesign related utilities often used in digital typography include font editors for design and modification and utilities to convert fonts from one format to another
0,ubiquitous or pervasive computing focuses not on individual computers and tasks but on a world where most objects including furniture and appliances have the ability to communicate information this has also been called the internet of things this can be viewed as the third phase in a process where the emphasis has gradually shifted from individual desktops 1980s to the network and internet 1990s to mobile presence and the ambient environmentsome examples of ubiquitous computing might include picture frames that display pictures attuned to the user s activities dashboard devices that can be set to display changing information such as weather and stock quotes parking meters that can provide verbal directions to nearby attractions kiosks or other facilities to provide verbal cues to guide travelers such as through airports home monitoring systems that can sense and deal with accidents or health emergencies
0,the essential core of the unix system is the kernel which provides facilities to organize and access files move data to and from devices and control the running of programs processes in designing unix thompson deliberately kept the kernel small noting that he wanted maximum flexibility for users since the kernel was the only part of the system that could not be reconfigured or replaced by the user he limited it to those functions that reliability and efficiency dictated be handled at the system level another way in which the unix kernel was kept simple was through device independence this meant that instead of including specific instructions for operating particular models of terminal printers or plotters within the kernel generic facilities were provided these could then be interfaced with device drivers and configuration files to control the particular devices a unix system typically has many users each of whom may be running a number of programs the interface that processes user commands is called the shell it is important to note that in unix a shell is just another program so there can be and are many different shells reflecting varying tastes and purposes traditional unixshells include the bourne shell sh c shell csh and korn shell ksh modern unix systems can also have graphical user interfaces similar to those found on windows and macintosh personal computers
0,traditional print and broadcast media divide the world into two groups content producers and content consumers however as noted by its creator tim berners lee at its very beginning the world wide web had at least the potential for users to take an active role in linking existing content and contributing their own indeed berners lee wanted web client software to include not only browsing functions but easy ways for users to create their own web pages in reality early users faced something of a learning curve usually having to cope with html to some extent for example but by the mid 2000s a variety of new media of communication had become readily accessible using an ordinary web browser at sites that host the required software the most prominent applications are blogs and wikis particularly wikipedia meanwhile inexpensive digital still and video cameras and easy to use editing software encouraged people to make their own media creations sites to enable users to upload share and comment on their creations have flourished the growth of sites such as facebook and myspace has also provided new ways for users from junior high school age on up to create and share content
0,the marketplace has spoken and the desktop gui is now the mainstream interface for most ordinary pc users however there are a variety of other interfaces that are used for particular circumstances or applications such as touchscreens as with atms handwriting or written gesture recognition such as on handheld computers or for drawing tablets voice controlled systems trackballs joysticks and touchpads used as mouse alternatives virtual reality interfaces using head mounted systems sensor gloves and so on because much interaction with computers is now away from the desktop and taking place on laptops handheld or palm computers and even in cars there is likely to be continuing experimentation with user interface design
0,dating back to the mid 1990s vbscript is a scripting language developed by microsoft and based on its popular visual basic programming language it is also part of the evolution of what microsoft called active scripting based on components that allow outside access to the capabilities of applications the host environment in which scripts run is provided through windows as with windows script host or within microsoft s internet explorer browser for client side processing vbscript can be used to write scripts embedded in html pages which interact with the standard document object model in a way similar to other web scripting languages in particular see javascript however vbscript is not supported by popular non microsoft browsers such as firefox and opera so developers generally must use the widely compatible javascript instead vbscript can also be used for processing on the web server particularly in connection with microsoft s web servers because versions of windows starting with windows 98 include windows script host vbscripts can also be written to run directly under windows one unfortunate consequence was scripts containing worms such as the i love you worm or other malware and mailed as attachments to unwary use
0,when videotape first became available in the 1950s recorders cost thousands of dollars and could only be afforded by tv studios today the vcr is inexpensive and ubiquitous however it is hard to edit videotape tape is a linear medium meaning that to find a given piece of video the tape has to be moved to that spot removing or adding something involves either physically splicing the tape as is done with film or more commonly feeding in tape from two or more recorders onto a destination tape besides being tedious and limited in capabilities linear editing by copying loses a bit of quality with each copying operation today however it is easy to shoot video in digital form or to convert analog video into digital form digital video is a stream of data that represents sampling of the source signal such as from the chargecoupled device ccd that turns light photons into electron flow in a digital camera or digital camcorder this process involves either software or hardware compression for storage and decompression for viewing and editing such a scheme is called a codec for compression decompression the most widely used formats include dv digital video and mpeg motion picture expert group which has versions that vary in the amount of compression and thus fidelity
0,a little later bulletin boards and especially systems such as the well whole earth lectronic link based in the san francisco bay area provided long term outlets for people to share information and interact on line looking at the well a writer named howard rheingold introduced the term virtual community in a 1993 book he explored the ways in which a sufficiently compelling and versatile technology encouraged people to form long term contacts form personal relationships and carry out feuds when on line participants experience such a venue as the well as a place that becomes almost as tangible and often as real as a physical place such as a small town or corner bar virtual community members who live in the same geographical area sometimes do get together physically the well has had picniclike well office parties for many years members can band together to support a colleague who faces a crisis such as the life threatening illness of a son on the well blank postings called beams are often used as an expression of sympathy the virtual community can also serve as a rallying point following a physical disaster such as the 1989 earthquake in the san francisco bay area on a daily basis virtual communities can often provide help or advice from a remarkable variety of highly qualified experts
0,the computing field virtualization involves the creation of a working model or representation of one system within a different system this idea has been widely used in the field since the 1960s some applications of virtualization include an appropriate model of a system such as a programming framework see application programming interface that hides unneeded details can make it easier for programmers to understand and access its functions a compiler for a language that compiles all programs to an intermediate representation such as bytecode a virtual machine running on each kind of platform can then run the code taking care of the details required by the host hardware a virtual machine created in software can be designed to perform all the functions available on a particular hardware platform or operating system allowing software to be run on a system different from the one for which it was originally written for example there are a number of virtualization programs such as vmware for pcs that can create separate areas in memory each running a different operating system such as a version of windows or linux multiple processors or entire computers can be treated as a single entity for processing a program with software designed to assign threads of execution to physical processors and to coordinate the use of shared data a physical device such as a disk drive can be made to appear as several separate devices to the operating system for better organization of data similarly many servers can run on the same physical machine conversely multiple drives can appear to be a single logical device while providing redundancy and error recovery a secure virtual private network can be created within the larger public internet the virtual system takes care of encrypting and transmitting data through the physical network
0,the concept of virtualization can also be applied to how work involving computers is being conceptualized and organized in the modern world a virtual office or even virtual corporation is a business entity that is not tied to a physical location but uses networks communications technology and facilities such as video conferencing to keep workers in touch alternatively several organizations can share the same physical space such as for mail or shipping while maintaining their separate identities similarly people can form long lasting social networks while meeting physically seldom if at all see socialnetworking and virtual community
0,besides military training currently the most viable application for vr seems to be entertainment vr techniques have been used to create immersive experiences in elaborate facilities at venues such as disneyland and universal studios and to some extent even in local arcades vr that is accompanied by convincing physical sensations has allowed for the creation of a new generation of roller coasters that if built physically would be too expensive too dangerous or even physically impossible however there are other significant emerging applications for vr when combined with telerobotic technology vr techniques are already being used to allow surgeons to perform operations in new ways vr technology can also be used to make remote conferencing more realistic and satisfactory for participants clearly the potential uses for vr for education and training in many different fields are endless vr technology combined with robotics could also be used to give disabled persons much greater ability to carry out the tasks of daily life in the ultimate vr system users will be networked and able to simultaneously experience the environment interacting both with it and one another the technical resources and programming challenges are also much greater for such applications the result however might well be the sort of environment depicted by science fiction writers such as william gibson
0,the basic idea of voip is simple the internet can carry packets of any sort of data which means it can carry the digitized human voice as well carrying ordinary phone calls there are several ways to do this a regular phone plus an adapter that connects to the computer and compresses and converts between regular analog phone signals and the digital equivalent a complete ip phone unit that includes all needed hardware and software no computer needed just a network connection such as to a router use of the computer s own sound card and speakers with a microphone plus software often free using that last option voip service can be essentially free regardless of distance however one can only call someone who is currently connected to the internet and also has voip software
0,at least as currently implemented voip does have some disadvantages like cordless phones but unlike traditional phones voip requires that the user be connected to power this may make the system unavailable in an emergency also in an emergency a 911 operator has no way to know where the caller is located geographically this could be a problem if the caller is unable to provide this information while a regular phone is a pretty simple device voip requires special hardware or a pc which might fail voip requires a working internet connection in practice a high speed connection load or instability in the network could cause interruptions in calls or a lowering of voice quality as with other data sent over the internet there are potential security concerns encryption can be used to secure voip calls but this in turn leads to concerns by law enforcement agencies seeking to implement eavesdropping warrants
0,for some time technology pundits have talked about computers being literally woven into daily life embedded in clothing and personal accessories however implementations have thus far seen only limited use for example watches with limited computer functions have not proven popular a watch large enough for input and display of information would likely be too bulky for comfort people have also walked about with attached webcams although the novelty seems to have quickly worn off
0,although the most important part of web 2 0 is its business and social models a number of web technologies are needed to provide the flexibility and rich interaction needed to offer a new web experience these include dynamic efficient generation of content programming interfaces using structured text files platforms for running applications in the browser such as google apps merging and customizing content from different sources user subscription to content platforms for user created content and collaboration
0,some typical features of a modern web browser include navigation buttons to move forward and back through recently visited pages tabs to switch between web pages a history panel allowing return to pages visited in recent days a search button that brings up the default search engine which can be chosen by the user the ability to save page as favorites or bookmarks for easy retrieval
0,today a web user can view a live news broadcast listen to music from a radio station or view a document formatted to near print quality all these activities are made possible by helper software that gives the web browser the capability to load and display or play files in special formats examples include the adobe pdf portable document format reader the windows media player and realplayer for playing video and audio content what makes the browser even more versatile is the ability to load and run programs from web sites java was highly touted starting in the mid 1990s and some observers believed that by making web browsers into platforms capable of running any sort of software there would be less need for proprietary operating systems such as microsoft windows
0,thousands of real time views of the world are available on the web these include everything from the prosaic a coffee machine at mit to the international a view of downtown paris or tokyo to the sublime a rocky mountain sunset all of these views are made possible thanks to the availability of inexpensive digital cameras to create a basic webcam the user connects a digital camera to a pc usually via a usb cable a program controls the camera taking a picture at frequent intervals perhaps every 30 seconds or minute the picture is received from the camera as a jpg jpeg file the program then uploads the picture to the user s web page usually using file transfer protocol or ftp replacing the previous picture users connected to the web site can click to see the latest picture alternatively a script running on the server can update the picture automatically
0,the web filter examines requests made by a web user and blocks those associated with sites deemed by the filter user to be objectionable there are two basic mechanisms for determining whether a site is unsuitable the first is to check the site s address url against a list and reject a request for any site on the list most filter programs come with default lists the filter user can add other sites as desired generally the filter is installed with a password so only the authorized user such as a parent can change the filter s behavior the other filtering method relies on a list of keywords associated with objectionable activities such as pornography when the user requests a site the filter checks the page for words on the keyword list if a matching word or phrase is found the site is blocked and not shown to the user
0,there are many online services including some free ones that will provide users with personal web pages there are also programs such as microsoft frontpage that allow users to design web pages by arranging objects visually on the screen and setting their properties however creating and maintaining a complete web site with its many linked pages interactive forms and interfaces to databases and other services is a complicated affair for most moderate to large size organizations it requires the services of a new category of it professional the webmaster
0,understanding how the web site responds to and manages requests fluency in the basic formatting of text and other page content and the use of frames and other tools for organizing and presenting text extended formatting and content organization facilities such as cascading style sheets css dynamic html dhtml and extensible markup language use of graphics formats and graphics and animation programs such as photoshop flash and dreamweaver extending the interactivity of web pages through writing scripts using tools such as javascript and php dealing with platform and compatibility issues including browser compatibility
0,when a user types in or clicks on a link in the browser window the browser sends a http request to construct the request the browser first looks at the address url in the user request an address such as well com conferencing html consists of three parts in order to direct the browser s request to the appropriate host and server the browser sends the url to a name server the name server provides the appropriate numeric ip address the browser then sends an http get request to the server s ip address assuming the page requested is valid the server sends the html file to the browser the browser in turn interprets the formatting and display instructions in the html file and renders the text and graphics appropriately it is remarkable that this whole process from user click to displayed page usually takes only a few seconds even if the web site is thousands of miles away and requests must be relayed through many intervening computers
0,there are several ways in which web services can be accessed remote procedure call rpc which generally uses wsdl and follows a format similar to the traditional way programs call upon library functions an organization based on the available messages rather than calls or operations representational state transfer rest which views applications or services as collections of resources with specific addresses urls and specific requests using variety of other specifications and approaches can be used this area is a very fluid one fortunately programmers and even users can build new web applications without having to know the details of how the underlying services work
0,wiki software varies in details such as use of markup languages programming interface and platform however most wikis include the following features users can create new pages articles or edit existing ones pages contain links to related pages sometimes using wiki words where wordsarescrunchedtogetherwithintialcaps simple markup can be used to create such effects as boldface headings or lists the wiki software usually translates this to html for rendering a record is kept of each contribution or edit often displayed on a recent changes page many wikis use a database such as mysql to store and retrieve pages some wikis simply store each page as a file and a few such as tiddlywiki store all pages together as a single document wikis can be public open to anyone or restricted such as to members of an organization the administrator of the wiki establishes guidelines or standards such as for citing sources for facts and procedures for dealing with disputes and controversial topics
0,typically a wireless lan uses a frequency band with each unit on a slightly different frequency thus allowing all units to communicate without interference although radio frequency is now most popular wireless lans can also use microwave links which are sometimes used as an alternative to ethernet cable in large facilities usually there is a network access point a pc that contains a transceiver and serves as the network hub it may also serve as a bridge between the wireless network and a wired lan the hub computer can also be connected to a high speed internet service via dsl or cable it has an antenna allowing it to communicate with wireless pcs up to several hundred feet away depending on building configuration each computer on the wireless network has an adapter with a transceiver so it can communicate with the access point the adapter can be built in as is the case with some handheld computers or mounted on a pc card for laptops or an isa card for desktop pcs or connected to a usb port
0,the term word processor was actually coined by ibmin the 1960s to refer to a system consisting of a selectric typewriter with magnetic tape storage this allowed the typist to record keystrokes and some data such as margin settings on tape material could be corrected by being rerecorded the tape could then be used to print as many perfect copies of the document as required a version using magnetic cards instead of tape appeared in 1969 the first modern style word processor was marketed by lexitron and linolex it also used magnetic tape but it added a video display screen now the writer could see and correct text without having to print it first a few years later a new invention the floppy disk became the standard storage medium for dedicated word processing systems the word processing systems developed by wang digital equipment corporation data general and others became a feature in large offices in the late 1970s these systems were essentially minicomputers with screens keyboards and printers and running a specialized software program because these systems were expensive ranging from about 8 000 to 20 000 or more they were not affordable by smaller businesses typically they were operated by specially trained personnel who became known also as word processors to whom documents were funneled for processing as with the old typing poo

0,in recent years there has been growing concern that internet users may eventually be treated differently by service pro viders depending on the kind of data they download or the kind of application programs they use online advocates of network or net neutrality want legislation that would bar cable dsl or other provid ers from making such distinctions such as by charging content pro viders higher fees for high volumes of data or even blocking certain applications advocates of net neutrality believe that since there are rather limited choices for broadband internet service discrimination on the basis of web content could lead to a loss of freedom for consumers and providers alike
0,nlp is a multidisciplinary field that draws from linguis tics and computer science particularly artificial intelligence in terms of linguistics a program must be able to deal with words that have multiple mean ings wind up the clock and the wind is cold today as well as grammatical ambiguities in the phrase little girl s school is it the school that is little the girls or both of course each language has its own forms of ambiguity programs can use several strategies for dealing with these problems including using statistical models to predict the likely meaning of a given phrase based on a corpus of existing text in that language as formidable as the task of extracting the correct lit eral meaning from text can be it is really only the first level of natural language processing if a program is to success fully summarize or draw conclusions about a news report from north korea for example it would also have to have a knowledge base of facts about that country and or a set of frames about how to interpret vari ous situations such as threat bluff or compromise
0,users of modern operating systems such as microsoft win dows are familiar with multitasking or running several programs at the same time for example a user might be writing a document in a word processor pause to check the e mail program for incoming messages type a page address int o a web browser then return to writing meanwhile the operating system may be running a number of other pro grams tucked unobtrusively into the background such as a virus checker task scheduler or system resource monitor each running program takes turns using the pc s cen tral processor in early versions of windows multitasking was cooperative with each program expected to periodically yield the processor to windows so it could be assigned to the next program in the queue one weakness of this approach is that if a program crashes the cpu might be locked up and the system would have to be rebooted however win dows nt 2000 and xp as well as operating systems such as unix use preemptive multitasking the operating sys tem assigns a slice of processing cpu time to a program and then switches it to the next program regardless of what might be happening to the previous program thus if a pro gram crashes the cpu will still be switched to the next program and the user can maintain control of the system and shut down the offending program

0,whatever memory chips or other devices are installed in a computer the operating system and application programs must have a way to allocate use and eventually release portions of memory the goal of memory management is to use available memory most efficiently this can be difficult in modern operating environments where dozens of pro grams may be competing for memory resources early computers were generally able to run only one program at a time these machines didn t have a true oper ating system just a small loader program that loaded the application program which essentially took over control of the machine and accessed and manipulated the memory later systems offered the ability to break main memory into several fixed partitions while this allowed more than one program to run at the same time it wasn t very flexible
0,if computers were merely fast sequential calculators they would still be of some use however much of the power of the computer comes from its ability to carry out repetitive tasks without supervision the loop is the programming language structure that controls such activities virtually every language has some form of loop construct with vari ations in syntax ranging from the relatively english like cobol and pascal to the more cryptic c
0,starting in the 1980s many organizations sought to connect their employees desktop computers so they could share central databases share or back up files communicate via e mail and collaborate on projects a system that links computers within a single office or home or a larger area such as a building or campus is called a local area network lan larger networks linking branches of an organiza tion throughout the country or world are called wide area networks or wans see network
0,naturally there must be software to manage the transmis sion and reception of data packets the structure of a packet sometimes called a frame has been standardized with a preamble source and destination addresses the data itself a checksum and two special layers that interface with the differing ways that ethernet and token ring networks physi cally handle the packets
0,a list is a series of data items that can be accessed sequen tially by following links from one item to the next lists can be very useful for ordering or sorting data items and for storing them on a stack or queue there are two general approaches to constructing lists in a data list used with procedural programming languages such as c each list item consists of a structure consisting of a data member and a pointer the pointer called next contains the address of the next item a program can easily step through a list by starting with the first item process ing its data then using the pointer to move to the next item continuing until some condition is met or the end of the list is reached
0,lists are generally used to provide convenient access to rel atively small amounts of data where flexibility is required unlike an array a list need use only as much memory as it needs to accommodate the current number of items includ ing their associated pointers a lisp style node list can be even more flexible in that items with varying sizes and types of data can be included in the same list lists are thus a more flexible way to implement such things as look up tables
0,linux is an increasingly popular alternative to proprietary operating systems its development sprang from two sources first was the creation of open source versions of unix utili ties by maverick programmer richard stallman as part of the gnu gnu s not unix project during the 1980s although these tools were useful the kernel or basic set of operating system functions was still missing starting in 1991 another creative programmer linus torvalds began to release open source versions of the unix kernel the combination of the ker nel and utilities became known as linux a combination of linus and unix though stallman and his supporters believe that gnu linux is a more accurate name
0,the idea behind an operating system kernel is that there is a relatively small core set of primitive functions that are necessary for the operation of system services these functions can be provided in a single component that can be adapted and updated as desir able the fundamental services include process control scheduling how the processes pro grams or threads of execution within programs share the cpu switching execution between processes cre ating new processes and terminating existing ones interprocess communication sending messages between processes enabling them to share data or coordinate their data processing memory management allocating and freeing up memory as requested by processes as well as imple menting virtual memory where physical storage is treated as an extension of main ram memory see memorymanagement file system services creating opening reading from writing to closing and deleting files
0,javascript is one of several popular languages that can enable web pages to interact with users more quickly and efficiently the language first appeared in the mid 1990s netscape 2 browser under the name livescript technically javascript is the sun microsystems trademark for its implementation of a standard called ecmascript despite the name java script is not directly related to the java programming lan guage in its early years javascript was perhaps a victim of its own success having a relatively easy to use scripting lan guage provided an easier way to add features such as 3d buttons and pop up windows to formerly humdrum web forms however as with an earlier generation s fondness for multiple fonts early javascript programmers were often prone to add unnecessary and confusing clutter to web pages besides sometimes annoying users early javascript also suffered from significant differences in how it was implemented by the major browsers as a result netscape users were sometimes stymied by javascript written for micr osoft internet explorer and vice versa finally browser flaws have sometimes allowed javascript to be used to com promise security such as by installing malware infested browser helpers as a result many security experts began to recommend that users disable javascript execution in their browsers
0,java has largely fulfilled this promise for web developers c programmers have an easy learning curve to java since the two languages have very similar syntax and a similar use of classes and other object oriented features on the other hand programmers who don t know c benefit from java being more streamlined than c for example java avoids the necessity to use pointers and uses classes as the consistent building block of program structure software powerhouses such as microsoft until recently and ibm have joined sun in pro moting java another much touted feature of java is its platform independence the language itself is separate from the vari ous operating system platforms for each platform a java vir tual machine jvm is created which interprets or com piles the code generated by the java compiler so it can run on that platform for security java applets run within a sandbox or restricted environment so the user is protected from mali cious java programs for example programs are not allowed to access the user s disk or to connect the user s machine to another web site web browsers can also be set to disable the running of java applets
0,java is a computer language similar in structure to c although java is a general purpose programming language it is most often used for creating applications to run on the internet such as web servers a special type of java pro gram called an applet can be linked into web pages and run on the user s web browser as an object oriented language java uses classes that provide commonly needed functions including the creation of user interface objects such as windows and buttons a variety of sets of classes class frameworks are available such as the awt abstract windowing toolkit
0,an interpreter is a program that analyzes parses program ming commands or statements in a high level language creates equivalent executable instructions in machine code and executes them an interpreter differs from a compiler in that the lat ter converts the entire program to an executable file rather than processing and executing it a statement at a time many earlier versions of the basic programming lan guage were implemented as interpreters since an inter preter only has to hold one program statement at a time in memory it could run on early microcomputers that had only a few tens of thousands of bytes of system memory how ever interpreters run programs considerably more slowly than a compiled program would run one reason is that an interpreter throws away each source code statement after it interprets it this means that if a statement runs repeat edly it must be re interpreted each time it runs a compiler on the other hand would create only one set of machine code instructions for the loop and then move on also because a compiler keeps the entire program in memory it can analyze the relationship between multiple statements and recognize ways to rearrange or substitute them for greater efficiency

0,netnews also called usenet for unix user net work is in effect the world s largest computer bul letin board it began in 1979 when duke university and the university of north carolina set up a simple mechanism for posting text files that could be read by other users today there are tens of thousands of topical newsgroups and millions of messages called articles although still impressive in its quantity of content many web users now rely more on discus sion forums based on web pages
0,ftp file transport protocol enables the transfer of one or more files between any two machines con nected to the internet this method of file transfer has been largely supplanted by the use of download links on web pages except for high volume applica tions where an ftp server is often operated behind the scenes of a web link ftp is also used by web developers to upload file
0,telnet is another fundamental service that brought the internet much of its early utility telnet allows a user at one computer to log into another machine and run a program there this provided an early means for users at pcs or workstations to for example access the library of congress catalog online however if program and file permissions are not set properly on the host system telnet can cause security vulner abilities the telnet user is also vulnerable to having ids and passwords stolen since these are transmitted as clear unencrypted text as a result some online sites that once supported telnet access now limit access to web based forms another alternative is to use a program called secure shell or ssh or to use a telnet client that supports encryption
0,wais wide area information service is a gateway that allows databases to be searched over the inter net wais provided a relatively easy way to bring large data resources online it too has largely been replaced by web based database services
0,the internet is the worldwide network of all computers or networks of computers that communicate using a particu lar protocol for routing data from one computer to another as long as the programs they run follow the rules of the protocol the computers can be connected by a variety of physical means including ordinary and special phone lines cable fiber optics and even wireless or satel lite transmission
0,internationalization and localization are ways to adapt computer software often created in the united states or europe to other languages and cultures the abbreviations i18n and l10n are sometimes used for internationalization and localization respectively the numbers in each word refer to the number of letters in the alphabet between the letters the two processes are complementary
0,by the mid 2000 decade the biggest intellectual property battles were not about esoteric program codes but rather revolved around how to satisfy the ordinary home consum er s appetite for music and video while preserving produc ers revenues increasingly music and even video is being downloaded rather than being bought in commercial pack aging at the local store in the sony v universal case 1984 the supreme court ruled that manufacturers of devices such as vcrs were not liable for their misuse if there were substantial non infringing uses such as someone making a copy of legally possessed media for their own use however in 2005 the supreme court ruled that grokster a decentralized file sharing service could be held liable for the distribution of illegally copied media if it actively induced such copying by 2006 media industry lobbyists particularly the recording industry institute of america or riaa were promoting a number of bills in congress that would fur ther restrict consumers rights to use media such mea sures might include requiring that devices be able to detect flagged media and refuse to copy it as well as adding stricter provisions to the digital millennium copyright act dmca these mea sures are opposed by cyber libertarian groups such as the electronic frontier foundation and consumer groups such as the home recording rights coalition
0,intellectual property can be defined as the rights the cre ator of an original work such as an invention or a book has to control its reproduction or use developers of new computer hardware software and media content must be able to realize a return on their time and effort this return is threatened by the ease with which programs and data on disks can be illicitly copied and redistributed several legal mechanisms can be used to deter such behavior
0,information theory is the study of the fundamental charac teristics of information and its transmission and reception as a discipline information theory took its impetus from the ideas of claude shannon in his seminal paper a mathematical theory of com munication published in the bell system technical journalin 1948 shannon analyzed the redundancy inherent in any form of communication other than a series of purely ran dom numbers because of this redundancy the amount of information expressed in binary bits needed to convey a message will be less than the number in the original mes sage it is because of redundancy that data compression algorithms can be applied to text graphics and other types of files to be stored on disk or transmitted over a network
0,while much attention is paid by system designers to the representation storage and manipulation of information in the computer the ultimate value of information processing software is determined by how well it provides for the effec tive retrieval of that information the quality of retrieval is dependent on several factors hardware data organization search algorithms and user interface
0,image processing is a general term for the manipulation of a digitized image to produce an enhanced or more con venient version some of the earliest applications were in the military aerial and later satellite reconnaissance and in the space program the military and space programs had a great need for extracting as much useful information as possible from images that were often gathered under extreme or marginal conditions they also needed to make cameras and other hardware components simultaneously more compact and more efficient and generally had the funds to pay for such specialized developments once developed higher quality image processing sys tems found their way into other applications such as domes tic surveillance and medical imaging the development of cameras that could directly turn light into digitized images made image processing seam less by avoiding the necessity of scanning images from tra ditional film image processing applications can be divided into three general categories enhancement interpretation and maintenance
0,starting in the late 1950s in computer facilities at mit stanford and other research universities people began to encounter persons who had both unusual programming skill and an obsession with the inner workings of the machine while ordinary users viewed the computer sim ply as a tool for solving particular problems this peculiar breed of programmers reveled in extending the capabilities of the system and creating tools such as program editors that would make it easier to create even more powerful programs the movement from mainframes that could run only one program at a time to machines that could simulta neously serve many users created a kind of environmental niche in which these self described hackers could flourish indeed while administrators sometimes complained that hackers took up too much of the available computer time they often depended on them to fix the bugs that infested the first versions of time sharing operating systems hack ers also tended to work in the wee hours of the night while normal users slept
0,the base 16 or hexadecimal system is a natural way to rep resent the binary data stored in a computer it is more com pact than binary because four binary digits can be replaced by a single hex digit the following table gives the corresponding decimal binary and hex values from 0 to 15 note that decimal and hex digits are the same from 0 to 9 but hex uses the letters a f to represent the digits cor responding to decimal 10 15 the system extends to higher numbers using increasing powers of 16 just as decimal uses powers of 10 for example hex ff represents binary 111 11111 or decimal 255 many of the apparently arbitrary numbers encountered in programming can be better under stood if one realizes that they correspond to convenient groupings of bits ff is eight bits sufficient to hold a single character in low level pro gramming memory addresses are also usually given in hex
0,in operating systems and certain programming languages such as lisp a heap is a pool of memory resources avail able for allocation by programs the memory segments sometimes called cells can be the same size or of variable size if the same size they are linked together by pointers memory is then allocated for a vari able by traversing the list and setting the required number of cells to be owned by that variable while some lan guages such as pascal and c use explicit memory allocation or deallocation functions other languages such as lisp use a separate runtime module that is not the responsibility of the programmer
0,in the early days of computing the programmers of a sys tem tended to also be its users and were thus intimately familiar with the program s operation and command set to search a hashed database the hashing formula is first applied to the search key yielding a hash value that value can then be used in a binary search to quickly zero in on the matching record if any health personalif not a programmer the user of a mainframe program was probably at least a well trained operator who could work with the aid of a brief summary or notes provided by the programmer however with the beginnings of office auto mation in the 1970s and the growing use of desktop com puters in office home and school in the 1980s increasingly complex programs were being put in the hands of users who often had only minimal computer training while programs often came with one or more tutorial or reference manuals designers realized that offering help through the program itself would have some clear advan tages first the user would not have to switch attention from the computer screen to look things up in a manual second the help system could be programmed to not only provide information but also to help the user find the informa tion needed in a given situation for example related topics could be linked together and a searchable index provided
0,a hash is a numeric value generated by applying a math ematical formula to the numeric values of the characters in a string of text the for mula is chosen so that the values it produces are always the same length regardless of the length of the original text and are very likely to be unique two different strings should not produce the same hash value such an event is called a collision
0,the two major application areas for hashing are informa tion retrieval and cryptographic certification in databases an index table can be built that contains the hash values for the key fields and the corresponding record number for each field with the entries in hash value order to search the database an input key is hashed and the value is compared with the index table which can be done using a very fast binary search if the hash value is found the corresponding record number is used to look up the record this tends to be much faster than searching an index file directly
0,even after decades of evolution in computing the hard disk drive remains the primary means of fast data storage and retrieval in computer systems of all sizes the disk itself consists of a rigid aluminum alloy platter coated with a magnetic oxide material the platter can be rotated at speeds of more than 10 000 rpm a typical drive consists of a stack of such platters mounted on a rotating spindle with a read write head mounted above each platter early hard drive heads were controlled by a stepper motor which positioned the head in response to a series of electrical pulses this system is still used for floppy drives today s hard drives however are controlled by a voice coil actuator similar in structure to an audio speaker the coil surrounds a magnet when a current enters the coil it gen erates a magnetic field that interacts with that of the perma nent magnet moving the coil and thus the disk head unlike the stepper motor the voice coil is continuously variable and its greater precision allows data tracks to be packed more tightly on the platter surface increasing disk capacity the storage capacity of a drive is determined by the number of platters and the spacing and thus number of tracks that can be laid down on each platter capacities have steadily increased while prices have plummeted in 1980 for example a hard drive for an apple ii microcom put er cost more than 1 000 and held only 5 mb of data as of 2007 internal hard drives with a capacity of 500 gb or more cost around a 150 00

0,a handwriting recognition system begins by building a representation of the user s writing with a pen or stylus system this representation is not simply a graphical image but includes the recorded strokes or discrete movements that make up the letters the software must then create a representation of features of the handwriting that can be used to match it to the appropriate character templates handwriting recognition is actually an application of the larger problem of identifying the significance of features in a pattern
0,a number of handheld computers beginning with apple s newton in the mid 1990s and the now popular palm devices and blackberry have some ability to recognize handwrit ing however current systems can be frustrating to use 0 handwriting recognitionbecause accuracy often requires that users write very care fully and consistently or as in the case of the palm even replace their usual letter strokes with simplified alternatives that the computer can more easily recognize if the user is allowed to use normal strokes the system must be gradu ally trained by the user giving writing samples and con firming the system s guess about the letters as the software becomes more adaptable and processing power increases allowing more sophisticated algorithms or larger neural networks to be practical users will be able to write more naturally and systems will gain more consumer acceptance one step in this direction is the tablet pc a notepad sized computer with a digitizer tablet and a stylus and handwrit ing recognitions software included in windows xp and expanded in windows vista programs such as microsoft onenote use handwriting recognition to allow users to incorporate handwritten text into notes that can be orga nized and quickly retrieved currently handwriting recognition is used mainly in niche applications such as collecting signatures for deliv ery services or filling out electronic forms in applications where the user must be mobile and relatively hands free
0,game consoles are computer devices dedicated to or pri marily used for playing video games the earliest such devices appeared in the 1970s from magnavox and then atari and could only play simple games like pong a crude simulation of ping pong slightly later systems began to feature cartridges that allowed them to play a greater vari ety of games
0,the normal method for getting a computer to perform a task is to specify the task clearly choose the appropriate approach and then implement and test the code however this approach requires that the pro grammer first know the appropriate approach and even when there are many potentially suitable algorithms it isn t always clear which will prove optimal
0,variations of genetic algorithms or evolutionary program ming have been used for many applications in engineering development a virtual environment can be set up in which a simulated device such as a robot arm can be allowed to evolve until it is able to perform to acceptable specifica tions nasa has also used genetic programs competing on 80 computers to design a space antenna different versions of an expert system program can be allowed to compete at performing tasks such as predicting the behavior of finan cial markets finally a genetic program is a natural way to simulate actual biological evolution and behavior in fields such as epidemiology
0,a genetic program consists of a number of copies of a routine that contain encoded genes that represent ele ments of algorithms the routines are given a task such as sorting data or recognizing patterns and the most suc cessful routines are allowed to reproduce by exchanging genetic material often further mutation or variation is introduced at this stage to increase the range of available solutions the new generation is then allowed to tackle the problem and the process is repeated as a result the routines become increasingly efficient at solving the given problem just as organisms in nature become more perfectly adapted to a given environment

0,geographic data can be stored as either a raster or a vector representation a raster system divides the area into a grid and assigns values to each cell in the grid for exam ple each cell might be coded according to its highest point of elevation the amount of vegetation ground cover it has its population density or any other factor of interest the simple grid system makes raster data easy to manipulate but the data tends to be coarse since there is no informa tion about variations within a cell
0,the power of geographic information systems comes from the ability to integrate data from a variety of sources whether aerial photography census records or even scanned paper maps once in digital form the data can be represented in a variety of ways for various purposes a sophisticated gis can be queried to determine for example how much of a pro posed development would have a downhill gradient and be below sea level such that flooding might be a problem these results can in turn be used by simulation programs to deter mine for example whether release of a chemical into the groundwater from a proposed plant site might affect a partic ula r town two miles away geographic information systems are thus vital for the management of a variety of complex systems that are distributed over a geographical area such as water and sewage systems power transmission grids and traffic control systems other applications include emergency planning and evacuation routes and the long term study of the effects of global warming trends
0,globalization can be described as a group of trends that are breaking down the boundaries between national and regional economies making countries more dependent on one another and resulting in the freer flow of labor and resources these trends have been praised by free trade advocates and decried by proponents of labor rights and environmentalism however one feels about them it is clear that global trends are reshaping the computer and information industry in many ways and pose significant challenges
0,global trends that affect computer technology software and services include offshoring or the continuing movement of manufac turing of high value components and whole systems from the industrialized west to regions such as asia outsourcing moving functions such as technical support from a company s home country to areas where suitable labor forces are cheaper removal of traditional intermediaries such as brokers and agents with some of their functions being taken over by software decentralized networks of which the internet itself is the most prominent example and the tendency of information to flow freely and quickly despite barri ers such as censorship virtualization creation of work groups or whole companies that are distributed across both space and time 24 hours coordinated by the internet and mobile communications increasing use of open source and collaborative mod els of software and information development blurring of the distinction between consumers and producers of information
0,computer related businesses must also deal with the effects of globalization on the market for hardware software and services lower cost offshore manufacturing has helped contribute to making many computer systems and peripher als into commodity items this certainly benefits consum ers consider the ubiquitous 100 or less computer printer however it becomes more difficult to extract a premium for a brand as opposed to a generic name some companies have responded by relentless efforts to maximize efficiency in manufacturing while a few others have maintained a reputation for style or innovation consumers have increasingly objected however to the difficulty in dealing with offshore technical support while the power of the internet has opened many new ways of reaching potential customers around the world dealing with a global marketplace brings considerable added complications such as the need to deal with different regulatory systems in some areas there is also the problem of unauthor ized copying of software and media products

0,prior to the late 1970s most computer applications other than some scientific and experimental ones did not use graphics however the early microcomputer systems such as the apple ii radio shack trs 80 and commodore pet could all display graphics either on a monitor or with the aid of a video modulator on an ordinary tv set while primitive low resolution monochrome or just a handful of colors this graphics capability allowed for a thriving mar ket in games and educational software the earliest video displays for mainstream pcs pro vid ed basic text display capabilities such as the mda or monochrome display adapter with 25 lines of text up to 80 characters per line plus the ability to create graphics by setting the color of individual pixels the typical low endgraphics card of the early 1980s was the cga color graphics adapter which offered various modes such as 320 by 200 pixels with four colors computers marketed forprofessional use offered the ega enhanced graph ics adapter which could show 640 by 350 pixels at 16 colors
0,broadly speaking a graphics file consists of data that speci fies the color of each pixel dot in an image since there are many ways this information can be organized there are a variety of graphics file formats
0,in a bitmap format there is a group of bits i e a binary value that specifies the color of each pixel windows pro vides standard bitmap bmp formats for 1 bit 2 colors or monochrome 4 bit 16 colors 8 bit 256 colors or 24 bit 16 million colors the windows bitmap format is also called a dib device independent bitmap because the stored colors are independent of the output device to be used such as a monitor or printer the relevant device driver is responsible for translating the color to one actually used by the device because it is native to windows bmp is widely used especially for program graphics resources
0,bitmap formats have the advantage of storing the exact color of every pixel without losing any information how ever this means that the files can be very large from hundreds of thousands of bytes to several megabytes for windows screen graphics bmp and other bitmap formats do support a simple method of compression called run length encoding rle where a series of identical pixels is replaced by a single pixel and a count bitmap files can be further compressed through the use of utilities such as the popular zip program
0,eps encapsulated postscript is a vector based rather than bitmap raster format this means that an eps file consists not of the actual pixel values of an image but the instruc tions for drawing the image including coordinates colors and so on the instructions are specified as a text file in the versatile postscript page description language this for mat is usually used for printing and requires a printer that supports postscript there are also postscript renderers that run entirely in software but they tend to be slow and some what unreliable
0,gif or graphics interchange format is a bitmapped format promulgated by compuserve instead of reserving enough space to store a large number of colors in each pixel this format uses a color table that can hold up to 256 colors each pixel contains a reference index into the color table this means that gif works best with images that have rela tively few colors and for applications such as web pages where compactness is important gif also uses compres sion to achieve compactness but unlike the case with jpeg it is a lossless compression called lzw there is also a gif format that stores simple animations
0,jpeg which stands for joint photographic experts group is widely used for digital cameras because of its ability to highly compress the data in a color graphics image allow ing a reasonable number of high resolution pictures to be stored in the camera s onboard memory the compression is lossy meaning that information is lost during compres sion at relatively low compression ratios such as 10 1 or 10 percent of the original image size changes in the image due to data loss are unlikely to be graphics formatsperceived by the human eye at higher ratios approaching 100 1 the image becomes seriously degraded jpeg s abil ity to store thousands of colors unlike gif s limit of 256 makes the format particularly suitable for the subtleties of photography
0,pcx is a compressed bitmap format originally used by the popular pc paintbrush program in recent years it has been largely supplanted by bmp and tiff
0,tiff or tagged image file format is also a compressed bitmap format there are several variations by different vendors which can lead to compatibility problems imple mentations can use various compression methods gener ally leading to ratios of 1 5 to 1 to about 2 to 1
0,while conventional pointing devices are quite satisfactory for making selections and even manipulat ing objects many artists prefer the control available only through a pen or pencil which allows the angle and pres sure of the stylus tip to be varied creating precise lines and shading a graphics tablet also called a digitizing tablet is a device that uses a specially wired pen or pencil with a flat surface tablet besides tracking the location of the pen and tra nslating it into x y screen coordinates the tablet also has pressure sensors depending on sensitivity the tablet can recognize 256 512 or 1024 levels of pressure in com bination with buttons on the pen the pressure level can be used to control the line thickness transparency or color in addition the driver software for some graphics tablets includes additional functions such as the ability to program the pen to control features of such applications as adobe photoshop
0,this is a general term for features that reduce the growing environmental impact of the manufacture or use of comput ers this impact has several aspects energy consumption resource consumption e waste and pollution and green house emissions
0,computers consume a variety of resources starting with their manufacturing and packaging resource consumption can be reduced by building more compact units and by designing components so they can be more readily stripped and recycled or reused adopting reusable storage media such as rewrit able cds recycling printer toner cartridges and changing office procedures to minimize the generation of paper docu ments are also ways to reduce resource consumption
0,in recent years the disposal of obsolete computers and other electronic equipment e waste has been both a grow ing concern and a business opportunity there are many toxic substances in electronics components including lead mercury and cadmium processing e waste to recover raw materials is expensive so greater emphasis has been placed on disassembling machines and reusing or refurbishing their individual components meanwhile many communi ties have banned disposing of e waste in regular trash and some have offered opportunities to drop off e waste at no or minimal charge states such as california have also insti tuted a recycling fee that is collected upon sale of devices such as crt monitors and televisions
0,fabrication of computer chips in more than 200 large plants around the world involves a variety of toxic chemicals and waste products the silicon valley alone is home to 29 toxic sites under the epa s superfund program the shift of much of semiconductor and computer component manufacturing to countries such as china that have less strict pollution controls has also exacerbated what has become a global problem whether through regulation or enlightened self interest companies that want to reduce future emissions can use several strategies manufacturing equipment and processes can be modified so they create fewer toxic substances or at least keep them from getting into the environment non toxic or less toxic materials can be substituted where possible for example use of ozone depleting chlorofluo rocarbons cfcs as cleaning agents has been largely elimi nated finally waste can be properly sorted and disposed of and recycled wherever feasible like other major manufacturing sectors the computer industry is also faced with the need to reduce the amount of the greenhouse gases particularly co2 contributing to global warming this mainly means further reducing the energy consumption of new pcs in june 2007 a number of major players including google intel dell hewlett packard microsoft and sun established the climate savers computing initiative going beyond energy star the pro gram is expected to reduce power consumption equivalent to 54 million tons of greenhouse gases annually about the same as that produced by 11 million cars or 20 large coal fired power plants
0,grid or cluster computing involves the creation of a sin gle computer architecture that consists of many separate computers that function much like a single machine the computers are usually connected using fast networks the purpose of the arrangement can be to provide redundant processing in case of system failures to dynamically balance a fluctuating work load or to split large computations into many parts that can be performed simultaneously this latter approach to high performance computing creates the virtual equivalent of a very large and powerful machine
0,grid and cluster architectures often overlap but the term grid tends to be applied to a more loosely coordinated structure where the computers are dispersed over a wider area not a local network in a grid the work is usually divided into many separate packets that can be processed independently without the computers having to share data each task can be completed and submitted without waiting for the completion of any other task clusters or the other hand more closely couple computers to act more like a single large machine
0,popular groupware software suites such as lotus notes and microsoft exchange generally offer at least some of the following features e mail coordination including the creation of group or task oriented mail lists shared calendar giving each participant information about all upcoming events meeting management including scheduling ensur ing compatibility with everyone s existing schedule and facilities booking scheduling tasks with listing of persons responsible for each task progress milestones met and check ing off completed tasks real time chat or instant message capabilities documentation systems that allow a number of people to make comments on the same document and see and respond to each other s comments whiteboard systems that allow multiple users to draw a diagram or chart in real time with everyone able to see and possibly modify it

0,fault tolerance is a design concept that recognizes that all computer based systems will fail eventually the question is whether a system as a whole can be designed to fail grace fully this means that even if one or more components fail the system will continue to operate according to its design specifications even if its speed or throughput must decrease
0,there are a number of ways to make a system more fault tolerant individual components such as hard drives can be composed of multiple units so that the remaining units can take over if one fails if each key component has at least one backup then there should be time to replace the primary before the backup also fails another way to achieve fault tolerance is to provide mul tiple paths to successful completion of the task in fact this is how packet switched networks like the internet work if one communications link is down or too congested packets are given an alternative routing fault diagnosis software can also play an important role both in determining how to respond to a problem beyond any automatic response and for providing data that will be useful later to system administrators or technicians some fault diagnosis systems can use elaborate rules to pinpoint the cause of a fault and recommend a solution
0,the amount of fault tolerance to be provided for a sys tem depends on a number of factors how important is it that the system not fail how critical is a given component to the operation of the system how likely is it that a given component will fail mean time between failures or mbtf how expensive is it to make the component or system fault tolerant
0,a fiber optic or optical fiber cable transmits photons light instead of electrons depending on the diameter of the cable the light is guided either by total internal reflec tion or as a waveguide manipulating refraction these principles were known as early as the mid 19th century and began to be used in the 20th century for such applications as dental and medical illumination and in experiments in transmitting images for television
0,optical fiber in its modern form was developed in the 1950s the glass fiber through which the light passes is surrounded by a transparent cladding designed to provide the needed refractive index to keep the light confined the cladding in turn is surrounded by a resin buffer layer and often an outer jacket and plastic cover fiber used for com munication is flexible allowing it to bend if necessary early optical fiber could not be used for practical com munication because of progressive attenuation weakening of the light as it traveled however by the 1970s the attenu ation was being reduced to acceptable levels by removing impurities from the fibers today the light signals can travel hundreds of miles without the need for repeaters or amplifi ers in the 1990s a new type of optical fiber photonic crys tal using diffraction became available this kind of fiber is particularly useful in applications that require higher power signals
0,optical fiber has several advantages over ordinary electric cable for communications and networking the signals can travel much farther without the need for a repeater to boost the signal also the ability to modulate wavelengths allows optical fiber to carry many separate channels greatly increas ing the total data throughput optical fiber does not emit rf radio frequency energy a source of cross talk interfer ence in electrical cable fiber is also more secure than elec trical cable because it is hard for an eavesdropper to tap today fiber is used for most long distance phone lines and internet connections many cable television systems are upgrading from video cable to fiber because of its greater reliability and ability to carry more bandwidth and enhanced data services
0,at bottom information in a computer is stored as a series of bits which can be grouped into larger units such as bytes or words that represent particular numbers or characters in order to be stored and retrieved a collection of such binary data must be given a name and certain attributes that describe how the information can be accessed this named entity is the file
0,the file system is the facility of the operating system that organizes files for example on dos and older windows pcs there is a file allocation table fat that consists of a linked list of clusters each cluster consists of a fixed number of sectors varying with the overall size of the disk when the operating system is asked to access a file it can go through the table and find the clusters belonging to that file read the data and send it to the requesting applica tio n modern file systems further organize files into groups called folders or directories which can be nested several lay ers deep such a hierarchical file system makes it easier for users to organize the dozens of applications and thousands of files found on today s pcs for example a folder called book might have a subfolder for each chapter which in turn con tains folders for text and illustrations relating to that chapter
0,the ultimate organization of data in a file depends on the application a typical approach is to define a data record with various fields the program might have a loop that repeatedly requests a record from the file processes it in some way and repeats until the operating system tells it that it has reached the end of the file this would be a sequential access a program can also be set up for ran dom access which means that an arbitrary record can be requested and that request will be translated into the cor rect physical location in the file the two approaches can be combined in isam indexed sequential access method where the records are stored sequentially but fields are indexed so a particular record can be retrieved
0,the growth in desktop computing since the 1980s has resulted in much data being moved from mainframe com puters to desktop pcs which are now usually linked by networks while a network enables users to exchange files there remains the problem of storing large files or collec tions of files such as databases that are too large for a typi cal pc hard drive or that need to be accessed and updated by many users the common solution is to obtain a computer with large fast disk drives this computer the file server is equipped with software often included with the networking package that serves provides files as requested by users or applications on the other pcs on the network see also client servercomputing the specifics of configuring the server for optimum efficiency providing adequate security and arranging for backup or archiving varies with the particular network operating sys tem in use the most popular environments are windows nt vista and the various versions of unix and linux
0,the file server has many advantages over storing the files needed by each user on his or her own pc by storing the files on a central server ordinary users pcs do not need to have larger more expensive disk drives central storage also makes it easier to ensure that backups are run regularly
0,file sharing services allow participants to provide access to files on their personal computers such as music or video in turn the user can browse the service to find and down load material of interest the structure is generally that of a peer to peer p2p network with no central server the first major file sharing service was napster this was a p2p network but had a central server that provided the searchable list of files and locations but not the files themselves which were downloaded from users pcs napster was forced to close in 2001 by legal action from copyright holders a new but unrelated for pay service opened later under the same name
0,many services today use the popular bittorrent file shar ing protocol a bittorrent client either the program of that name or another compatible one can transmit or receive any type of data to share a file the client creates a tor rent a small file that contains metadata describing the file and an assignment to a tracker the tracker is another computer node that coordinates the distribution of the file although this sounds complicated and a request takes longer to set up than an ordinary http connection the advantage is that once set up downloading is efficiently managed even for files for which there is high demand the downloading client connects to multiple clients that provide pieces of the desired file because of its efficiency bittorrent allows for distribution of substantial amounts of data at low cost particularly since the system scales up automatically without having to provide extra resources bittorrent is currently being used for a variety of legally distributed material including video sound and textual content
0,because of their frequent use to share copyrighted music video or other material a variety of organizations of copy right owners have sued file sharing services and or their users the biggest problem for the courts is to determine whether there is substantial non infringing use that is the service is being used to exchange legal data some file sharing services have been accused of dis tributing malware viruses or spyware or of being used to distribute material that is illegal per se such as child pornography in response to litigation threats file sharing services have tended to become more decentralized and some have features that increase anonymity of users or use encryption
0,with today s networked pcs and the use of e mail attach ments it is easy to send a copy of a file or files from one computer to another because networks already include all the facilities for doing so earlier many pcs were not net worked but could be connected via a dial up modem to established the connection a terminal program running on one pc had to negotiate with its counterpart on the other machine agreeing on whether data would be sent in 7 or 8 bit chunks and the number of parity bits that would be included for error checking the sending program would inform the receiving program as to the name and basic type of the file for binary files files intended to be interpreted as literal binary codes as with executable programs images and so on the contents would be sent unchanged for text files there might be the issue of which character set 7 bit or 8 bit ascii was being used and whether the ends of lines were to be marked with a cr carriage return character an lf linefeed or bot
0,once the programs agree on the basic parameters for a file transfer the transfer has to be managed to ensure that it completes correctly typically files are divided into blocks of data such as 1k or 1024 bytes each during the 1970s ward christensen developed xmodem the first widely used file transfer program for pcs running cp m and later ms dos and other operating systems xmodem was quite reli able because it incorporated a checksum and later a more advanced crc to check the integrity of each data block if an error is detected the receiving program requests a retransmission
0,the role of the computer in film begins well before the first camera rolls writers can use computers to write scripts while specialized programs can be used to lay out storyboards using 3d programs somewhat like cad drafting programs set designers can experiment with the positioning of objects before deciding on a final design and obtaining or creating the physical props for mattes backgrounds against which the characters will be shot in a scene a computer generated scene can now be inserted directly into the film without the need for an expensive hand painted backdrop
0,there are many calculations or other processes that can be described using a specific series of states or conditions for example the state of a combination lock depends not only on what numeral is being dialed or punched at the moment but on the numbers that have been previously entered an even simpler example is a counter such as a car odometer whose next output is equal to one increment plus its cur rent setting in other words a state based device has an inherent memory of previous steps
0,many programs and operating systems are structured as an endless loop where an input or command is processed the results returned the next input is processed and so on until an exit command is received a mode or state can be used to determine the system s activity for example a program might be in different modes such as waiting for input processing input displaying results and so on the program logic will refer to the current state to determine what to do next and at some point the logic will transitionthe system to the next state in the sequence the validity of some kinds of programs protocols or circuits can therefore be proven by showing that there is an equivalent finite state machine and thus that all possible combinations of inputs have been accounted for finite state machines have many other interesting appli cations simple organisms can be modeled as a set of states that interact with the environment the lower level functions of robots can also be represented as a set of interacting finite state machines even video game characters often use fsms to give them a repertoire of plausible behavior
0,the vulnerability of computer systems to malicious or criminal attack has been greatly increased by the growing number of connections between computers and local net works and the worldwide internet the widespread use of permanent broadband connections by consumers such as dsl and cable modem links has increased the risk to home users intruders can use port scanning programs to determine what connections a given system or network has open and can use other programs to snoop and steal or destroy sensitive data
0,typical firewall functions include examining incoming data packets and blocking those that include commands to examine or use unauthor ized ports or ip addresses blocking data packets that are associated with com mon hacking techniques such as trojans or back door exploitationsthis diagram shows a finite state representation of a zip code the arrows link each state within a circle to its possible successor in this simple example each digit must be followed by another digit until the fifth digit which can either be followed by a blank indi cating a five digit zip code or four more digits for a 9 digit zip firewall hiding all the internal network addresses on a local network presenting only a single address to the outside world this is also called nat or network address translation monitoring particular applications such as ftp file transfer protocol and telnet remote login restrict ing them to certain addresses often a special address called a proxy is established rather than allowing direct connections between the outside and the local network
0,firewire is a high speed serial interface used by personal computers and digital audio and video equipment the name firewire is an apple brand name but it is used gener ically technically it is the ieee 1394 serial bus firewire was developed in the 1990s by the ieee p1394 working group with substantial funding from apple and help from engineers from major corporations including ib m digital equipment corporation dec sony and texas instruments in 1993 it was hailed as the most sig nificant new technology by byte magazine
0,common uses for firewire include connecting digital video such as camcorder devices audio devices and some data storage devices firewire is favored over usb 2 0 for many professional applications because of its higher speed and power distribution capabilities however it is more expensive than usb 2 0 which provides sufficient speed for many consumer peripherals such as digital cameras and printers
0,a flag is a variable that is used to specify a particular condi tion or status usually a flag is either true or false for example a flag valid form could be set to true before the input form is processed if the validation check for any data field fails the flag would be set to false after the input procedure has ended the main program would check the valid form flag if it s true the data on the form is processed for example continuing on to the payment process if the flag is false the input form might be redis played with errors or omissions highlighted
0,in computers the term flash mob typically refers to a group of individuals who organize a spontaneous and coordinated online activity such as a social media campaign or an online protest flash mobs often use social media platforms and other online tools to mobilize large groups of people quickly and efficiently flash mobs can take many different forms ranging from coordinated tweets or facebook posts to more elaborate online events such as virtual marches or protests they are often used to draw attention to a particular cause raise awareness about an issue or promote a message or idea
0,smart mobs are similar in organization to flash mobs but tend to be more purposeful and enduring forms of social organization the phenomenon was first described by how ard rheingold in his book smart mobs the next social revolution rheingold describes several examples of smart mobs including teenage thumb tribes in tokyo and helsinki finland named for their use of tiny thumb operated keyboards on cell phones their typical activities included organizing impromptu raves or converging on rock stars or other celebrities
0,a flash or thumb drive is a small data storage device that uses semiconductor flash memory rather than a disk drive it is connected to a digital device using the universal serial bus because most computers digital cameras and other digital devices have usb ports a flash drive is a convenient way to provide up to 16 gb as of 2007 of low power rewritable memory flash drives first appeared in late 2000 flash drives can use a separate usb cable useful when several devices need to be connected to closely spaced usb ports or simply have a connector that plugs directly into the port many people who regularly work with several computers carry their backup data or even a complete oper ating system such as linux on a flash drive perhaps con nected to their keyring
0,the traditional computer display uses a cathode ray tube crt like that in a television set the flat panel display is an alternative used in most laptop com puters and some higher end desktop systems the most common type uses a liquid crystal display lcd the dis play consists of a grid of cells with one cell for each of the three colors red green and blue for each pixel
0,until the mid 1990s the floppy disk or diskette was the primary method for distributing software and providing removable data storage for personal computers diskettes first appeared in the late 1960s on ibm minicomputers and became more widespread on a variety of minicomputers and early microcomputers during the 1970s the now obsolete 8 inch and 5 inch disks were made from mylar with a metal oxide coating the assembly being housed in a flexible cardboard jacket hence the term floppy disk the more compact 3 5 inch diskettes first widely introduced with the apple macintosh in 1984 became the standard type for all pcs by the 1990s these diskettes are no longer truly floppy and come in a rigid plastic case
0,a flowchart is a diagram showing the flow or progress of operations in a computer program flowcharting was one of the earliest aids to program design and documentation and a plastic template with standard flowcharting symbols was a common programming accessory today case com puter aided software engineering systems often include utilities that can automatically generate flowcharts based on the control structures and procedure calls found in the program code the standard flowchart symbols include blocks of vari ous shapes that represent input output data processing sorting and collating and so on lines with arrows indicate the flow of data from one stage or process to the next a diamond shaped symbol indicates a decision to be made by the program if the decision is an if separate lines branch off to the alternatives if the decision involves repeated testing the line returns back to the decision point while another line indi cates the continuation of processing after the loop exits devices such as printers and disk drives have their own symbols with lines indicating the flow of data to or from the device
0,in computing a font refers to a typeface that has a distinc tive appearance and style in most word processing desk top publishing and other programs the user can select the point size at which the font is to be displayed and printed in traditional typography each point size would be consid ered to be a separate font operating systems such as win a flowchart uses a set of simple symbols to describe the steps involved in a data processing operation the parallelograms indi cate an input output operation such as reading or writing a file the decision diamonds have yes and no branches depending on the result of a test or comparison 00 flowchartdows and macintosh usually come with an assortment of fonts and applications can register additional fonts to make them available to the system
0,there are two basic ways to store font data in the computer system bitmapped fonts store the actual pat tern of tiny dots that make up the letters in the font this has the advantage of allowing each letter in each point size to be precisely designed the primary disadvantage is the amount of memory and system resources required to store a font in many point sizes in practice this con sideration results in only a relatively few fonts and sizes being available
0,forth has a very simple structure the forth system con sists of a collection of words each word is a sequence of operations which can include other existing words for example the dup word makes a copy of a data value data is held by a stack for example the arithmetic expression written as 2 3 in most languages would be written in forth as 2 3 when the operator which in forth is a pre defined word executes it adds the next two numbers it encounters 2 and 3 together and puts the sum on the stack where in turn it might be fetched for further process ing by the next word in the program this rep resentation is also called postfix notation and is familiar to many users of scientific calculators
0,a key feature of forth is its extensibility once you have defined a word the new word can be used in exactly the same way as the predefined words the various forms of defining words allow for great control over what happens when a new word is created and when the word is later executed in many ways forth anticipated the principles of object oriented programming with words as objects with implicit construc tors and methods a well organized forth program builds up from primitive operations to the higher level words with the program itself being the highest level word
0,fortran formula translator was the first widely used high level programming language it was developed by a project begun in 1954 by a team under the leadership of i bm researcher john backus the goal of the project was to create a language that would allow mathematicians sci entists and engineers to express calculations in something close to the traditional notation at the same time a com piler would have to be carefully designed so that it would produce executable machine code that would be nearly as efficient as the code that would have been created through the more tedious process of using assembly languages see compiler and assembler
0,fractals and the related idea of chaos have profoundly changed the way scientists think about and model the world around 1960 benoit mandelbrot noticed that sup posedly random economic fluctuations were not distributed evenly but tended to form clumps as he investigated other sources of data he found that many other things exhibited this odd behavior he also discovered that the patterns of distribution were self similar that is if you magnified a portion of the pattern it looked like a miniature copy of the whol e mandelbrot coined the term fractal meaning frac tured or broken up to describe such patterns eventually a number of simple mathematical functions were found to exhibit such behavior in generating values
0,many computer users are familiar with the colorful fractal patterns generated by some screen savers there are hun dreds of families of fractals beginning with the famous mandelbrot set that can be color coded and displayed in endless detail but there are a number of more significant applications because of their ability to generate realistic textures at every level of detail many computer games and simulations use fractals to generate terrain interactively fractals can also be used to compress large digital images into a much smaller equivalent by creating a mathemati cal transformation that preserves and can be used to re cre ate the essential characteristics of the image military experts can use fractal analysis either to distinguish artifi cial objects from surrounding terrain or camouflage or to generate more realistic camouflage fractals and chaos the ory are likely to produce many surprising discoveries in the future in areas ranging from signal analysis and encryption to economic forecasting
0,functional languages have generally been used for special ized purposes although they can in principle perform any task that an imperative language can apl which is basi cally a functional language has devotees who appreciate its compact and powerful syntax for performing calculations lisp and its variants have long been favored for many artificial intelligence applications particularly natu ral language processing where its representation of data as lists and the facility of its list processing functions seems a natural fit proponents of functional languages argue that they free the programmer from having to be concerned with explic itly setting up and using variables in a functional language problems can often be stated in a more purely mathematical way further because functional programs are not orga nized as sequentially executed tasks it may be easier to implement parallel processing systems using functional languages however critics point out that imperative languages are much closer to how computers actually work employing actual storage locations and sequential operation and thus produce code likely to be much faster and more efficient than that produced by functional languages
0,at bottom a data bit in a computer is all or nothing 1 or 0 most decisions in computer code are also all or nothing either a condition is satisfied and execution takes one specified path or the condition is not satisfied and it goes elsewhere in real life of course many situations fall between the cracks for example a business might want to treat a credit applicant who almost qualifies for a status different from one who barely made b while a program could be refined to include many gradations between b and a another approach is to express the degree of closeness or certainty using fuzzy logic
0,ebayebay inc nasdaq symbol ebay is the world s largest online auction and shopping site the first appearance of the auction service was in 1995 as auctionweb part of the personal web site of pierre omidyar omidyar was surprised at how rapidly the auction service which was initially free grew after he imposed a modest listing fee omidyar found himself receiving thousands of dollars in small checks and decided that online auctions could become a full time business
0,an e book is a book whose text is stored in digital form and can be read on a pc or a handheld reading device since most books today are created on word processors and typesetting systems it is easy for a publisher to create an electronic version older books that exist only in printed form can be scanned and converted to text
0,a digital library is to e books what a conventional library is to printed books sometimes called an electronic library or virtual library digital libraries can be created in a variety of ways printed books can now be scanned and digitized rapidly google has said that it can scan 3 000 volumes a day using a proprietary system this is not necessary of course for books that were originally created in digital form
0,advantages of digital libraries include the following 166 e books and digital libraries there is never a shortage of copies or the need for a reader to wait for access many digital libraries allow full searching of the text of all volumes libraries can also use a common data format such as open archives to make their material searchable throughout the internet many older hard to find books can be made more discoverable and accessible
0,the most popular e commerce sectors today include the selling of books music and movies travel related services electronics clothing luxury goods and medications in 2006 online buyers actually spent more money on clothing than on computers and related products a number of other online activities can be considered part of e commerce although they are usually not included in retailing statistics
0,one continuing obstacle to the growth of e commerce has been consumers concerns about the theft or misuse of personal information gathered as part of the shopping process this can involve either fake web sites or legitimate businesses that sell information about customers without their knowledge or consent according to a report from gartner research more than 900 million in e commerce sales during 2006 was lost because of consumers security concerns and about a billion dollars more in sales was lost because customers decided not to buy online at all
0,in the early 1950s knowledge of computing tended to have and hoc nature on the practical level computing staffs tended to train newcomers in the specific hardware and machine level programming languages in use at a particular site on the theoretical level programmers in scientific fields were likely to come from a background in electronics electrical engineering or similar disciplines as it became clear that computers were going to play an increasingly important role courses specific to computing were added to curricula in mathematics and engineering by the late 1950s however leading people in the computing field had become convinced that a formal curriculum in computer science was necessary for further advance in an increasingly sophisticated computing arena by the early 1960s efforts at the university of michigan university of houston stanford and other institutions had resulted in the creation of separate graduate departments of computer science by the mid 1960s the national academy of sciences and the president s science advisory committee had both called for a major expansion of efforts in computer science education to be aided by federal funding during the 1970s and 1980s mathematical and engineering societies in particular the association for computing machinery acm and institute for electrical and electronic engineering ieee worked to established detailed computer science curricula that extended to undergraduate study by 2000 there were 155 accredited programs in computer science in the united states
0,basic was invented at dartmouth college in 1963 1964 by john g kemeny and thomas e kurtz both professors of mathematics assisted by a group of undergraduate student programmers computers then were huge slow and expensive there were no personal computers their goal was to bring easy and accessible computing to all students not just science or engineering students the method they chose called for developing a time shared operating system which would allow many users simultaneously this operating system was developed entirely by dartmouth undergraduate students the new language basic easy to learn and easy to use was an essential part of this effort basic was thus developed originally for a large multipleuser time shared system and not for personal computers which did not appear widely until the early 1980s it has been asked whybasicwas invented couldn t an existing language have been used for the purpose the answer to the second question is no which also answers the first question other computer languages did exist in 1963 although there were not nearly as many as there are today the principal ones were fortran and algol most of the others are long since forgotten some of the common languages used today c c and java had not even been conceived fortran and algol were each considered briefly these languages were designed for production use on big machines or for scientific research using punched cards but neither was suitable for use by beginners neither was particularly well suited for a time shared environment and neither permitted speedy handling of short programs kemeny and kurtz had experimented with other simple computer languages as early as 1956 but with only modest success so in 1963 when they began building a time shared system for students they quickly realized that a new language had to be invented basic
0,timing attacks were publicized by paul kocher in 1996 they attack the implementation of cryptosystems by measuring observable differences in the timing of the algorithm based on the particular value of the key they then use statistical methods to determine the bits of key by observing many operations using the same key timing attacks typically require a significant number of chosen ciphertexts related attacks can use any measure of differences in the performance of the encryption and decryption functions such as power consumption and heat dissipation timing attacks and related attacks can be protected against to some degree by blinding the devices performing encryption and decryption computations so that all computations have the same performance regardless of the particular key and message being used however this can have a substantial performance cost as it requires all computations to have worst case performance such attacks can also be protected against by designing systems so that they will not act as an oracle by decrypting and returning all and any messages that come their way thereby preventing an attacker from obtaining the necessary data to carry out the attack however this is not always possible without interfering with the purpose of the system
0,the arithmetic logic unit is the part of a computer system that actually performs calculations and logical comparisons on data it is part of the central processing unit cpu and in practice there may be separate and multiple arithmetic and logic units the alu works by first retrieving a code that represents the operation to be performed such as add the code also specifies the location from which the data is to be retrieved and to which the results of the operation are to be stored for example addition of the data from memory to a num ber already stored in a special accumulator register within the cpu with the result to be stored back into the accumu lator the operation code can also include a specification of the format of the data to be used such as fixed or float ing point numbers the operation and format are often combined into the same code in addition to arithmetic operations the alu can also carry out logical comparisons such as bitwise operations that compare corresponding bits in two data words corresponding to boolean operators such as and or and xor the data or operand specified in the operation code is retrieved as words of memory that represent numeric data or indirectly character data once the operation is per formed the result is stored typically in a register in the cpu special codes are also stored in registers to indicate characteristics of the result such as whether it is positive negative or zero other special conditions called excep tions indicate a problem with the processing common exceptions include overflow where the result fills more bits than are available in the register loss of precision because there isn t room to store the necessary number of decimal places or an attempt to divide by zero exceptions are typically indicated by setting a flag in the machine status register
0,an applet is a small program that uses the resources of a larger program and usually provides customization or addi tional features the term first appeared in the early 1990s in connection with apple s applescript scripting language for the macintosh operating system today java applets rep resent the most widespread use of this idea in web develop ment java applets are compiled to an intermediate repre sentation called bytecode and generally are run in a web browser applets thus represent one of several alternatives for interacting with users of web pages beyond what can be accomplished using simple text markup an applet can be invoked by inserting a reference to its program code in the text of the web page using the html applet element or the now preferred object element although the distinction between applets and scripting code such as in php is somewhat vague applets usually run in their own window or otherwise provide their own interface while scripting code is generally used to tailor the behavior of separately created objects applets are also rather like plug ins but the latter are generally used to provide a particular capability such as the ability to read or play a particular kind of media file and have a stan dardized facility for their installation and management some common uses for applets include animations of scientific or programming concepts for web pages support ing class curricula and for games designed to be played using web browsers animation tools such as flash and shockwave are often used for creating graphic applets to prevent badly or maliciously written applets from affecting user files applets such as java applets are gen erally run within a restricted or sandbox environment where for example they are not allowed to write or change files on disk
0,in personal computers a chipset is a group of integrated circuits that together perform a particular function system purchasers generally think in terms of the processor itself such as a pentium iii pentium iv or competitive chips from amd or cyrix however they are really buying a system chipset that includes the microprocessor itself and often a memory cache which may be part of the microprocessor or a separate chip see cache as well as the chips that control the memory bus which connects the processor to the main memory on the moth erboard see bus the overall performance of the system depends not just on the processor s architecture including data width instruction set and use of instruction pipe lines but also on the type and size of the cache memory the memory bus rdram or rambus and sdram and the speed with which the processor can move data to and from memory in addition to the system chipset other chipsets on the motherboard are used to support functions such as graphics the agp or advanced graphics port for example drive connection eide controller communication with exter nal devices and connections to expansion cards the pci bus at the end of the 1990s the pc marketplace had chip sets based on two competing architectures intel which originally developed an architecture called socket 7 has switched to the more complex slot 1 architecture which is most effective for multiprocessor operation but offers the advantage of including a separate bus for accessing the cac he memory meanwhile intel s main competitor amd has enhanced the socket 7 into super socket 7 and is offering faster bus speeds on the horizon may be com pletely new architecture in choosing a system consumers are locked into their choice because the microprocessor pin sockets used for each chipset architecture are different
0,a class is a data type that combines both a data structure and methods for manipulating the data for example a string class might consist of an array to hold the charac ters in the string and methods to compare strings combine strings or extract portions of a string as with other data types once a class is declared objects sometimes called instances of the class can be created and used this way of structuring programs is called object oriented programming because the class object is the basic building block object oriented programming and classes provide sev eral advantages over traditional block structured languages in a traditional basic or even pascal program there is no particular connection between the data structure and the procedures or functions that manipulate it in a large program one programmer might change the data structure without alerting other programmers whose code assumes the original structure on the other hand someone might write a procedure that directly manipulates the internal data rather than using the methods already provided either transgression can lead to hard to find bugs with a class however data and procedures are bound together or encapsulated this means that the data in a class object can be manipulated only by using one of the methods provided by the class if the person in charge of maintaining the class decides to provide an improved implementation of the data structure as long as the data parameters expected by the class methods do not change code that uses the class objects will continue to function properly
0,access control matrix means preparing a system permitting to bring together user and the system s available resources preparing a matrix requires the following steps a broad level of groups of resources that share the same or similar security objectives is established based on requirements for confidentiality integrity availability user accountability authentication and audit compliance cia uaa the resources include files directories applications databases hosts services processes and others including those protected by the operating system or by other mechanisms users are grouped according to common security needs into functional teams and a group owner is identified who is responsible for group management if necessary naming standards for resources can be defined based on the findings under 1 2 above thereby further facilitating resource groupings now a decision can be made on the degree of access such as read write execute take ownership access control delete purge modify file scan balancing central security control and group administration decides about the involvement of security administration a corporation s access control matrix should not become a static document but instead regular review and improvement is a must this matrix is closely linked to a role based access management system whereby user roles e g nurse versus private or general physician have roles to perform requiring access and modification of data or addition of new information regarding an electronic patient file
0,active os fingerprinting is conducted in order to detect the target s oper ating system it is usually done by sending specially crafted network packets and comparing them against known responses each operating system re sponds to different packet differently and even response to the ping command can give a good indication of the target os several methods have been developed and fingerprints are widely available on the internet the tool of the trade for this is a tool called network mapper nmap while active os fingerprinting is more accurate than passive os fingerprinting it has a significant disadvantage being active means that attackers have to send packets to the host hence active versus passive fingerprinting means risking discovery

0,ascii american standard code for information interchange is a series of standards used to identify simple characters numbers letters etc where each character is represented by a numerical code each character is assigned a 7 bit code whereby the bit has a minimum unit of data 0 zero or 1 ascii files can be created using simple text editors ascii is a universal computer code for english letters and characters computers store all information as binary numbers regardless of what make or brand the computer is ascii also refers to a protocol for copying files from one computer to another over a network in which neither computer checks for any errors that might have been caused by static or other problems the difficulty with ascii is twofold 1 2 all special fonts and elements used in a document typed using one software e g wordperfect will be lost when the file document is saved in ascii format and than reloaded by somebody else into wordperfect or even microsoft word for that matter and special characters such as those used in german cannot be transferred by ascii e g is transferred as a blank and an ue must be typed instead besides german for many languages e g chinese and japanese this represents a real problem for the above reasons a new source called unicode was developed as 8 bit codes only allow for 256 separate characters a single 8 bit en coding is not suitable for all text requirements even western alphabets have many characters and once languages of china and braille are included there are many thousands of characters that are needed of course within a given domain an implicit assumption of a particular character set could be made this leads to multiple 8 bit codes but it doesn t work for those character sets where more than 256 characters are needed in the same context both 7 bit ascii and the various 8 bit extensions of it can be considered to be subsets of unicode one does not need to know the above level of detail but it is important to see why ascii is insufficient and why a standard is required for character encodings

0,there are a variety of ways to electronically register store and process votes in recent years older manual systems paper ballots or mechanical voting machines have been replaced in many areas with systems ranging from purely digital touch screens to hybrid systems where marked paper ballots are scanned and tabulated by machine however voting systems have been subject to considerable controversy particularly following the florida debacle in the 2000 u s presidential election the criteria by which voting systems are evaluated include how easy it is for the voter to understand and use the system accessibility for disabled persons whether the voter s intentions are accurately recorded the ability to make a permanent record of the vote prevention of tampering physical or electronic provisions for independent auditing of the votes in case of disputethe degree to which a given system meets these criteria can vary considerably because of both design and implementation issues
0,the earliest form of voting system consisted of paper ballots marked and tabulated entirely by hand the first generation of automatic voting systems involved mechanical voting machines where votes were registered by pulling levers next came two types of hybrid systems where votes were cast mechanically but tabulated automatically these systems used punch cards or marksense or similar systems where the voter filled in little squares and the ballots were then scanned and tabulated automatically the ultraclose and highly disputed 2000 u s presidential election stress tested voting systems that most people had previously believed were reasonably accurate the principal problems were the interpretation of punch cards that were not properly punched through so called dimpled or hanging chads and the fact that some ballot layouts proved to be confusing or ambiguous two types of voting systems have been proposed as replacements for the problematic earlier technology
0,this type of system uses a screen display that can be directly manipulated by the voter in the most common type called dre direct recording electronic a computer program interprets and tabulates the vote as it is cast storing an image in a removable memory unit and usually printing out a copy for backup after voting is complete the memory module can be sent to the central counting office alternatively votes can be transmitted over a computer network in batches throughout the day in a few cases voting has also been implemented through secure internet sites
0,concern about potential tampering with computers has led many jurisdictions to begin to replace touchscreen systems with optical scan systems where the voter marks a sturdy paper ballot about half of u s counties now use optical scan systems the advantage of optical systems is that the voter physically marks the ballot and can see how he or she has voted and after tabulation the physical ballots are available for review in case of problems however optical scan ballots must be properly marked using the correct type of pencil or they may not be read correctly unlike the touchscreen it is not possible to give the voter immediate feedback so that any errors can be corrected optical ballot systems may cost more because of paper and printing costs for the ballots which may have to be prepared in several languages however this cost may be offset by not having to develop or validate the more complicated software needed for all electronic systems
0,electronic mail is perhaps the most ubiquitous computer application in use today e mail can be defined as the sending of a message to one or more individuals via a computer system open the file and look for messages in 1971 however the arpanet ancestor of the internet see internet was used by researchers at bolt beranek and newman bbn to send messages from a user at one computer to a user at another the availability of e mail helped fuel the growth of the arpanet through the 1970s and beyond connection development and architecturethe simplest form of e mail began in the 1960s as a way that users on a time sharing computer system could post and read messages the messages consisted of text in a file that was accessible to all users a user could simply log into the
0,when people think of a computer they generally think of a general purpose computing system housed in a separate box for use on the desk or as a laptop or hand held device however the personal computer and its cousins are only the surface of a hidden web of computing capability that reaches deep into numerous devices used in our daily lives modern cars for example often contain several specialized computer systems that monitor fuel injection or enhance the car s grip on the road under changing conditions many kitchen appliances such as microwaves dishwashers and even toasters contain their own computer chips communications systems ranging from cell phones to tv satellite dishes include embedded computers most important embedded systems are now essential to the operation of critical infrastructure such as medical monitoring systems and power transmission networks the potential vulnerability of embedded systems to the y2k date related problems was a major concern in the months leading up to 2000 especially because many embedded systems might have to be replaced rather than just reprogrammed in the event it turned out that there were relatively few date dependent systems and only minor disruptions were experienced
0,one consequence of the universal computer concept is that in principle any computer can be programmed to imitate the operation of any other an emulator is a program that runs on one computer but accurately processes instructions written for another for example fans of older computer games can now download emulation programs that allow modern pcs to run games originally intended for an apple ii microcomputer or an atari game machine emulators allowing macintosh and linux users to run windows programs have also achieved some success in order to work properly the emulator must set up a sort of virtual model of the target microprocessor including appropriate registers to hold data and instructions and a suitably organized segment of memory while carrying out instructions in software rather than in hardware imposes a considerable speed penalty if the processor of the emulating pc is much faster than the one being emulated the emulator can actually run faster than the original machine
0,in the earliest programming languages any part of a program could access any other part simply by executing an instruction such as jump or goto later the concept of the subroutine helped impose some order by creating relatively self contained routines that could be called from the main program at the time the subroutine is called it is provided with necessary data in the form of global variables or preferably parameters which are variable references or values passed explicitly when the subroutine is called when the subroutine finishes processing it may return values by changing global variables or changing the values of variables that were passed as parameters
0,the use of encryption to disguise the meanings of messages goes back thousands of years the romans for example used substitution ciphers where each letter in a message was replaced with a different letter mechanical cipher machines first came into general use in the 1930s during world war ii the german enigma cipher machine used multiple rotors and a configurable plugboard to create a continuously varying cipher that was thought to be unbreakable however allied codebreakers built electromechanical and electronic devices that succeeded in exploiting flaws in the german machine while incidentally advancing computing technology during the cold war western and soviet cryptographers vied to create increasingly complex cryptosystems while deploying more powerful computers to decrypt their opponent s messages
0,this concept refers to the organization of data processing and communications across an entire corporation or other organization historically computing technology and infrastructure often developed at different rates in the various departments of a corporation for example by the 1970s departments such as payroll and accounting were making heavy use of electronic data processing edp using mainframe computers the introduction of the desktop computer in the 1980s often resulted in operations such as marketing corporate communications and planning being conducted using a disparate assortment of software databases and document repositories even the growing use of networking often meant that an enterprise had several different networks with at best rudimentary intercommunication
0,much publicity has been given to figures such as microsoft founder and multibillionaire bill gates who turned a vest pocket company selling basic language tapes into the dominant seller of operating systems and office software for pcs historically however the role of key entrepreneurs in the establishment of information technology sectors repeats the achievements of such 19th and early 20th century technology pioneers as thomas edison and henry ford there appear to be certain times when scientific insight and technological capability can be translated into businesses that have the potential to transform society while making the pioneers wealthy
0,ergonomics is the study of the fit between people and their working environment because computers are such a significant part of the working life of so many people finding ways for people to maximize efficiency and reduce health risks associated with computer use is increasingly important since the user will be looking at the computer monitor for hours on end it is important that the display be large enough to be comfortably readable and that there be enough contrast glare on the monitor surface should be avoided it is recommended that the monitor be placed so that the top line of text is slightly below eye level a distance of about 18 inches to two feet roughly arm s length is recommended there has been concern about the health effects of electromagnetic radiation generated by monitors most new monitors are designed to have lower emissions
0,transmitting data involves the sending of bits ones and zeros as signaled by some alternation in physical characteristics such as voltage or frequency there are a number of ways in which errors can be introduced into the data stream for example electrical noise in the line might be interpreted as spurious bits or a bit might be flipped from one to zero or vice versa generally speaking the faster the rates at which bits are being sent the more sensitive the transmission is to effects that can cause errors while a few wrong characters might be tolerated in some text messages or graphics files binary files representing executable programs must generally be received perfectly since random changes can make programs fail or produce incorrect results data communications engineers have devised a number of methods for checking the accuracy of data transmissions
0,an important characteristic of quality software is its ability to handle errors that arise in processing also called run time errors or exceptions before it is released for general use a program should be thoroughly tested with a variety of input when errors are found the soundness of the algorithm and its implementation must be checked as well as the program logic interaction between the program and other programs including the operating system as well as with hardware must also be considered see bugsand debugging however even well tested software is likely to encounter errors therefore a program intended for widespread use must include instructions for dealing with errors anticipated or otherwise the process of error handling can be divided into four stages validation detection communication and amelioration
0,an expert system is a computer program that uses encoded knowledge and rules of reasoning to draw conclusions or solve problems since reasoning as opposed to mechanical calculation is a form of intelligent behavior the field of expert systems also called knowledge representation or knowledge engineering is part of the broader field of ai
0,an expert system has two main components a knowledge baseand an inference engine the knowledge base consists of a set of assertions facts or of rules expressed as if then statements that specify conditions that if true allow a particular inference to be drawn the inference engine accepts new assertions or queries and tests them against the stored rules because satisfying one rule can create a condition that is to be tested by a subsequent rule chains of reasoning can be built up if the reasoning is from initial facts to an ultimate conclusion it is called forward chaining if a conclusion is given and the goal is to prove that conclusion there can be backward chaining from the conclusion to the assertions
0,today the term data is associated in many peoples minds mainly with computers however data as in given facts or measurements has been used as a term by scientists and scholars for centuries just as with a counting bead a notch in a stick or a handwritten tally data as stored in a computer or on digital media is a representation of facts about the world these facts might be temperature readings customer addresses dots in an image the characteristics of a sound at a given instant or any number of other things but because computer data is not a fact but a representation of facts its accuracy and usefulness depends not only on the accuracy of the original data but on its context in the computer
0,abstract data types are used to describe a generic type of data specifying how the data is stored and what operations can be performed on it dfor example an abstract stack data type includes a structure for storing data such as a list or array and a set of operations such as pushing an integer onto the stack and popping removing an integer from the stack for the process of combining data and operations into a single entity see encapsulation abstract data types can be implemented directly in object oriented programming languages
0,one advantage of using abstract data types is that it separates a structure and functionality from its implementation in designing the abstract stack type for example one can focus on what a stack does and its essential functions one avoids becoming immediately bogged down with details such as what sorts of data items can be placed on the stack or exactly what mechanism will be used to keep track of the number of items currently stored this approach also avoids featuritis the tendency to see how many possible functions or features one can add to the stack object for example while it might be useful to give a stack the ability to print out a list of its items it is probably better to wait until one needs such a capability than to burden the basic stack idea with extra baggage that may make it more cumbersome or less efficient an abstract data type or its embodiment
0,there are a variety of ways in which data facts or measurements about the world can be turned into a digital representation suitable for manipulation by a computer for example pressing a key on the keyboard sends a signal that is stored in a memory buffer using a value that represents the ascii character code for the key pressed moving the mouse sends a stream of signals that are proportional to the rotation of the ball which in turn is calibrated into a series of coordinates and ultimately to a position on the screen where the cursor is to be moved digital cameras and scanners convert the varying light levels of what they see into a digital image
0,the data acquisition system begins with a transducer which is a device that converts a physical phenomenon such as heat into a proportional electrical signal transducers include devices such as thermistors thermocouples and pressure or strain gauges the output of the transducer is then fed into a signal conditioning circuit the purpose of signal conditioning is to make sure the signal fits into the range needed by the data processing device thus the signal may be amplified or its voltage may be adjusted or scaled to the required level another function of signal conditioning is to isolate the incoming signal from the computer to which the acquisition device is connected this is necessary both to protect the delicate computer circuits from possible spikes in the incoming signal and to prevent noise extraneous electromagnetic signals created by the computer itself from distorting the signal and thus the ultimate measurements various sorts of filters can be added for this purpose
0,data acquisition systems are essential to gathering and processing the detailed data required by scientific and engineering applications the automated control of chemical or biochemical processes requires the ability of the control software to assess real time physical data in order to make timely adjustments to such factors as temperature pressure and the presence of catalysts inhibitors or other components of the process the highly automated systems used in modern aviation and increasingly even in ground vehicles depend on real time data acquisition it is not surprising then that data acquisition is one of the fastest growing fields in computing
0,database administration is the management of database systems database administration can be divided into four broad areas data security data integrity data accessibility and system development
0,with regard to databases ensuring data security includes the assignment and control of users level of access to sensitive data and the use of monitoring tools to detect compromise diversion or unauthorized changes to database files when data is proprietary licensing agreements with both database vendors and content providers may also need to be enforced
0,data integrity is related to data security since the completeness and accuracy of data that has been compromised can no longer be guaranteed however data integrity also requires the development and testing of procedures for the entry and verification of data input as well as verifying the accuracy of reports output database administrators may do some programming but generally work with the programming staff in maintaining data integrity since most data in computers ultimately comes from human beings the training of operators is also important within the database structure itself the links between data fields must be maintained referential integrity and a locking system must be employed to ensure that a new update is not processed while a pending one is incomplete internal procedures and external regulations may require that a database be periodically audited for accuracy while this may be the province of a specially trained information processing auditor it is often added to the duties of the database administrator
0,accessibility has two aspects first the system must be reliable data must be available whenever needed by the organization and in many applications such as e commerce this means 24 hours a day 7 days a week 24 7 reliability requires making the system as robust as possible such as by mirroring the database on multiple servers which in turn requires making sure updates are stored concurrently failure must also be planned for which means the imple 130 database administrationmentation of onsite and offsite backups and procedures for restoring data
0,a database management system consists of a database a collection of information usually organized into records with component fields and facilities for adding updating retrieving manipulating and reporting on data
0,broadly speaking data communications is the transfer of data between computers and their users at its most abstract level data communications requires two or more computers a device to turn data into electronic signals and back again and a transmission medium telephone lines fiber optic cable network ethernet cable video cable radio wireless or other kinds of links can be used finally there must be software that can manage the flow of data
0,data communications are the basis both for networks and for the proper functioning of servers that provide services such as world wide web pages electronic mail online databases and multimedia content such as audio and streaming video while web page design and e commerce are the bright lights that give cyberspace its character data communications are like the plumbing without which computers cannot work together the growing demand for data communications particularly broadband services such as dsl and cable modems translates into a steady demand for engineers and technicians specializing in the maintenance and growth of this infrastructure
0,the process of removing redundant information from data so that it takes up less space is called data compression besides saving disk space compressing data such as e mail attachments can make data communications faster compression methods generally begin with the realization that not all characters are found in equal numbers in text for example in english letters such as e and s are found much more frequently than letters such as j or x by assigning the shortest bit codes to the most common characters and the longer codes to the least common characters the number of bits needed to encode the text can be minimized
0,the developer of each application program that writes data files must define a format for the data the format must be able to preserve all the features that are supported by the program for example a word processing program will include special codes for font selection typestyles such as bold or italic margin settings and so on in most markets there are more than one vendor so there is the potential for users to encounter the need to convert files such as word processing documents from one vendor s format to another for example a microsoft word user needing to send a document to a user who has wordperfect or the user may encounter another user who also has microsoft word but a later version
0,a modern enterprise database system can contain hundreds of separate data items each with important characteristics such as field types and lengths rules for validating the data and links to various databases that use that item there can also be many different views or ways of organizing subsets of the data and stored procedures program code modules used to perform various data processing functions a developer who is creating or modifying applications that deal with such a vast database will often need to check on the relationships between data elements views procedures and other aspects of the system
0,the process of analyzing existing databases in order to find useful information is called data mining generally a database whether scientific or commercial is designed for a data mining 135particular purpose such as recording scientific observations or keeping track of customers account histories however data often has potential applications beyond those conceived by its collector
0,a data structure is a way of organizing data for use in a computer program there are three basic components to a data structure a set of suitable basic data types a way to organize or relate these data items to one another and a set of operations or ways to manipulate the data for example the array is a data structure that can consist of just about any of the basic data types although all data must be of the same type the way the data is organized is by storing it in sequentially addressable locations the operations include storing a data item element in the array and retrieving a data item from the array
0,the data structures commonly used in computer science include arrays as discussed above and various types of lists the primary difference between an array and a list is that an array has no internal links between its elements data structures 137while a list has one or more pointers that link the elements there are several types of specialized list a tree is a list that has a root an element with no predecessor and each other element has a unique predecessor the guarantee of a unique path to each tree node can make the operations of inserting or deleting an item faster a stack is a list that is accessible only at the top or front any new item is inserted pushed on top of the last item and removing popping an item always removes the item that was last inserted this order of access is called lifo last in first out a list can also be organized in a first in first out fifo order this type of list is called a queue and is useful in a situation where tasks must wait their turn for attention
0,the preceding data types all hold single values however most modern languages allow for the construction of data types that can hold more than one piece of data the arrayis the most basic structured data type it represents a series of memory locations that hold data of one of the basic types thus in pascal an array of integer holds integers each taking up two bytes of memory many languages have composite data types that can hold data of several different basic types for example the struct in c or the record in pascal can hold data such as a person s first and last name three lines of address all arrays of characters or strings an employee number perhaps an integer or double a boolean field representing the presence or absence of some status and so on this kind of data type is also called a user defined data type because programmers can define and use these types in almost the same ways as they use the language s built in basic types what is the difference between data types and data structures there is no hard and fast distinction generally data structures such as lists stacks queues and trees are more complex than simple data types because they include data relationships and special functions such as pushing or popping data on a stack however a list is the fundamental data type in list processing languages such as lisp and string operators are built into languages such as snobol see list processing stack queue and tree further in many modern languages fundamental and structured data types are combined seamlessly into classes that combine data structures with the relevant operations
0,data warehousemodern business organizations create and store a tremendous amount of data in the form of transactions that become database records increasingly however businesses are relying on their ability to use data that was collected for one purpose such as sales customer service and inventory for purposes of marketing research planning or decision support for example transaction data might be revisited with a view to identifying the common characteristics of the firm s best customers or determining the best way to market a particular type of product in order to conduct such research or analysis the data collected in the course of business must be stored in such a way that it is both accurate and flexible in terms of the number of different ways in which it can be queried the idea of the data warehouse is to provide such a repository for data
0,a decision support system dss is a computer application that focuses on providing access to or analysis of the key information needed to make decisions particularly in business it can be thought of as a more narrowly focused approach to computer assistance to management see management information system the development of dss has several roots reaching back to the 1950s this includes operational analysis and the theory of organizations and the development of the first interactive rather than batch processing computer systems indeed the sage automated air defense system developed starting in the 1950s could be described as a military dss the system presented real time information radar plots and enabled the operator to select and focus on particular elements using a light pen by the 1960s more systematic research on dss was underway and included the provocative idea of human computer symbiosis for problem solving
0,dell computer nasdaq dell is one of the world s leading manufacturers and sellers of desktop and laptop computers by 2008 dell had more than 88 000 employees worldwide the company was founded by michael dell a student at the university of texas at austin whose first company was pc s limited founded in 1984 even at this early stage dell successfully employed several practices that would come to typify the dell strategy sell directly to customers not through stores build each machine to suit the customer s preferences and be aggressive in competing on price in 1988 the growing company changed its name to dell computer corporation in the early 1990s dell tried an alternative business model selling through warehouse clubs and computer superstores when that met with little success dell returned to the original formula in 1999 dell overtook compaq to become the biggest computer retailer in america
0,the unusual computing term demon sometimes spelled daemon refers to a process program that runs in the background checking for and responding to certain events the utility of this concept is that it allows for automation of information processing without requiring that an operator initiate or manage the process for example a print spooler demon looks for jobs that are queued for printing and deals with the negotiations necessary to maintain the flow of data to that device another demon called chron in unix systems reads a file describing processes that are designated to run at particular dates or times for example it may launch a backup utility every morning at 1 00 a m e mail also depends on the periodic operation of mailer demons
0,design patterns are an attempt to abstract and generalize what is learned in solving one problem so that it can be applied to future similar problems the idea was first applied to architecture by christopher alexander in his book a pattern language alexander described a pattern as a description of situations in which a particular problem occurs with a solution that takes into account the factors that are invariant not changed by context guidance for applying the solution is also provided for example a bus stop a waiting room and a line at a theme park are all places where people wait a place to wait pattern would specify the problem to be solved how to make waiting as pleasant as possible and suggest solutions patterns can have different levels of abstraction or scales on which they apply for example an intimate theater and a stadium are both places of entertainment but one is much larger than the other patterns in turn are linked into a network called a pattern language thus when working with one pattern the designer is guided to consider related patterns for example a pattern for a room might relate to patterns for seating or grouping the occupants
0,the concept of patterns and pattern languages carries over well into software design as with architectural patterns a software pattern describes a problem and solution along with relevant structures note that patterns are not executable code they are at a higher level one might say abstract enough to be generalizable specific enough to be applicable software patterns can specify how objects are created and ways in which they function and interface with other objects patterns are generally documented using a common format
0,traditionally documents such as advertisements brochures and reports were prepared by combining typed or printed text with pasted in illustrations such as photographs and diagrams this painstaking layout process was necessary in order to produce camera ready copy from which a printing company could produce the final product starting in the late 1980s desktop computers became powerful enough to run software that could be used to create page layouts in addition display hardware gained a high enough resolution to allow for pages to be shown on the screen in much the same form as they would appear on the printed page this is known by the acronym wysiwyg or what you see is what you get the final ingredient for the creation of desktop publishing was the advent of affordable laser or inkjet printers that could print near print quality text and high resolution graphics
0,a fundamental problem in computer design is the control of devices such as disk drives and printers each device is designed to respond to a particular set of control commands sent as patterns of binary values through the port to which the device is connected for example a printer will respond to a new page command by skipping lines to the end of the current page and moving the print head to the start of the next page taking margin settings into account the problem is this when an applications program such as a word processor needs to print a document how should the necessary commands be provided to the printer if every application program has to include the appropriate set of commands for each device that might be in use programs will be bloated and much development effort will be required for supporting devices rather than extending the functionality of the product itself instead the manufacturers of printers and other devices such as scanners and graphics tablets typically provide a program called a driver a version of the driver is created for each major operating system in use the driver serves as the intermediary between the application the operating system and the low level device control system it is sometimes useful to have drivers in the form of continually running programs that monitor the status of a device and wait for commands
0,also called digital money or e cash digital cash represents the attempt to create a method of payment for online transactions that is as easy to use as the familiar bills and coins in daily commerce at present credit cards are the principal means of making online payments while using credit cards takes advantage of a well established infrastructure it has some disadvantages from a security standpoint each payment potentially exposes the payer to the possibility that the credit card number and possibly other identifying information will be diverted and used for fraudulent transactions and identity theft while the use of secure encrypted online sites has reduced this risk it cannot be eliminated entirely credit cards are also impracticable for very small payments from cents to a few dollars such as for access to magazine articles because the fees charged by the credit card companies would be too high in relation to the value of the transaction
0,the concept of digital convergence is an attempt to explore the implications of so many formerly disparate analog media now being available in digital form all forms of digital media have key features in common first they are essentially pure information computer data this means that regardless of whether the data originally represented still images from a camera video or film the sound of a human voice music or some other form of expression that data can be stored manipulated and retrieved under the control of computer algorithms this makes it easier to create seamless multimedia presentations services or products previously considered to be separate can be combined in new ways
0,the dashboard of a car is designed to present vital real time information to the driver such as speed fuel supply and engine status ideally this information should be easy to grasp at a glance allowing for prompt action when necessary conversely unnecessary and potentially distracting information should be avoided or at least relegated to an unobtrusive secondary display a digital dashboard is a computer display that uses similar concepts its goal is to provide an executive or manager with the key information that allows him or her to monitor the health of the enterprise and to take action when necessary a digital dashboard can also be part of a larger set of management tools see decision support system
0,the term digital divide was coined in the late 1990s amid growing concern that groups such as minorities the elderly and rural residents were not becoming computer literate and connecting to the internet at the same rate as the young educated and relatively affluent nearly a decade later this perception of a chasm has diminished somewhat according to the pew internet american life project as of 2006 about two thirds 70 per 148 digital dashboardcent of american adults were using the internet and the number has continued to increase though more slowly there is evidence of a hard core unconnected population groups that lagged in internet usage included americans 65 years or older 35 percent african americans 58 percent and persons without at least a high school education 36 percent
0,by default once information is digitized it is simply a pattern of bits that can be easily copied within the same or a different medium using a variety of software or the built in facilities of the operating system of course the development of tape recording technology in the mid 20th century already made it possible to copy audio recordings and the later development of videotape and the vcr did the same for video however while analog copying techniques lose some accuracy or fidelity with each generation of copying digital files can be copied exactly each time it is equally easy to e mail upload or otherwise distribute audio or video files legally the creator of an original work can assert copyright literally the right to copy or to control when and how the work is distributed digital rights management drm refers to a variety of technologies that can be used to enforce this right by making it at least difficult for the purchaser of one copy of a work to copy and distribute it in turn similar technologies have also been used to prevent copying of software which is after all just another pattern of bits see copy protection and software piracy andcounterfeiting
0,this concept involves the creation of a software system that runs programs and stores data across a number of different computers an idea pervasive today a simple form is the central computer such as in a bank or credit card company with which thousands of terminals communicate to submit transactions while this system is in some sense distributed it is not really decentralized most of the work is done by the central computer which is not dependent on the terminals for its own functioning however responsibilities can be more evenly apportioned between computers
0,distributed computing is particularly suited to applications that require extensive computing resources and that may need to be scaled smoothly enlarged to accommodate increasing needs examples might include large databases intensive scientific computing and cryptography a particularly interesting example is seti which invites computer users to install a special screen saver that runs a distributed process during the computer s idle time the process analyzes radio telescope data for correlations that might indicate receipt of signals from an extraterrestrial intelligence besides being able to marshal very large amounts of computing power distributed systems offer improved fault tolerance because the system is decentralized if a particular computer fails its processes can be replaced by ones running on other machines replication copying of data across a widely dispersed network can also provide improved data recovery in the event of a disaster
0,the operation of the internet requires that each participating computer have a unique address to which data packets can be routed the domain name system dns provides alphabetical equivalents to the numeric ip addresses giving the now familiar looking web addresses urls e mail addresses and so on the system uses a set of top level domains to categorize these names one set of domains is based on the nature of the sites involved including com commercial corporate edu educational institutions gov government mil military org nonprofit organizations int international organizations net network service providers and so on the other set of top level domains is based on the geographical location of the site for example au australia fr france and ca canada while the united states has the us domain it is generally omitted in practice because the internet was developed in the united states
0,the document object model dom is a way to represent a web document as an object that can be manipulated using code in a scripting language the dom was created by the world wide web consortium w3c as a way to standardize methods of manipulating web pages at a time when different browsers used different access models the full specification is divided into four levels 0 through 3 by 2005 most domspecifications were supported by the major web browsers using dom a programmer can navigate through the hierarchical structure of a document following links or descending into forms and user interface objects with dom one can also add html or xml elements as well as load save or format documents
0,dsl digital subscriber line is one of the two most prevalent forms of high speed wired access to the internet dsl can operate over regular phone lines sometimes called pots or plain old telephone service dsl takes advantage of the fact that existing phone lines can carry frequencies far beyond the narrow band used for voice telephony when installing dsl the phone company must evaluate the quality of existing lines to determine how many frequency bands are usable and thus how much data can be transmitted further because the higher the frequency the shorter the distance the signal can travel the available bandwidth drops as one gets farther from the central office or a local dsl access multiplexer dslam
0,a digital video recorder dvr records digital television broadcasts and stores them on a disk dvrs first appeared as commercial products in 1999 in replay tv and tivo the latter becoming the most successful player in the field a dvr works with digital signals and discs rather than tape used by the video cassette recorders vcrs that had become popular starting in the 1980s the digital recorder has several advantages over tape much larger capacity limited only by hard drive size instant random access to any recorded programming without having to go forward or backward through a tape the ability to time shift within a live broadcast including pausing and instant replay the ability to skip over commercials digital special effects
0,the c programming language was developed in the early 1970s by dennis ritchie who based it on the earlier languages bcpl and b c was first used on dec pdp 11 computers running the newly developed unix operating system where the language provided a high level alternative to the use of pdp assembly language for development of the many utilities that give unix its flexibility since the 1980s c and its descendent c have become the most widely used programming languages
0,introduced in 2002 c pronounced c sharp is a programming language similar to c and java but simplified in several respects and tailored for use with microsoft s latest programming platform c is a general purpose language and is thoroughly objectoriented all functions must be declared as members of a class or struct and even fundamental data types are derived from the system object class compared with c c is stricter about the use and conversion of data types not allowing most implicit conversions such as from an enumeration type to the corresponding integer see data structures unlike c c does not permit multiple inheritance where a type can be derived from two or more base types thereby avoiding an added layer of complexity in class relationships in large software projects however a similar effect can be obtained by declaring multiple interfaces or specified ways of accessing the same class unlike java but like c c includes pointers and a safer version called delegates enumerations enum types structs treated as lightweight classes and overloading multiple definitions for operators the latest version of the language c 3 0 introduced in 2007 provides additional features for list processing and functional programming
0,the c language was designed by bjarne stroustrup at at t s bell labs in murray hill new jersey starting in 1979 by that time the c language had become well established as a powerful tool for systems programming however stroustrup and others believed that c s limited data structures and function mechanism were proving inadequate to express the relationships found in increasingly large software packages involving many objects with complex relationships
0,during the late 1980s and 1990s c became a very popular language for a variety of applications ranging from systems programming to business applications and games the growth of the language coincided with the development of more powerful desktop computers and the release of inexpensive easy to use but powerful development environments from microsoft borland and others since these compilers could also handle traditional c code programmers could port existing code and use the object oriented techniques of c as they mastered them by the late 1990s however c although still dominant in many areas was being challenged by java a language that simplified some of the more complex features of c and that was designed 68 c particularly for writing software to run on web servers and browsers for an alternative approach to creating a somewhat more streamlined c type language
0,a basic problem in computer design is how to optimize the fetching of instructions or data so that it will be ready when the processor cpu needs it one common solution is to use a cache a cache is an area of relatively fast access memory into which data can be stored in anticipation of its being needed for processing caches are used mainly in two contexts the processor cache and the disk cache
0,the use of a processor cache is advantageous because instructions and data can be fetched more quickly from the cache static memory chips next to or within the cpu than they can be retrieved from the main memory usually dynamic ram an algorithm analyzes the instructions currently being executed by the processor and tries to anticipate what instructions and data are likely to be needed in the near future for example if the instructions call for a possible branch to one of two sets of instructions the cache will load the set that has been used most often or most recently since many programs loop over and over again through the same instructions until some condition is met the cache s prediction will be right most of the time
0,a disk cache uses the same general principle as a processor cache here however it is ram either a part of main memory or separate memory on the disk drive that is the faster medium and the disk drive itself that is slower when an application starts to request data from the disk the cache reads one or more complete blocks or sectors of data from the disk rather than just the data record being requested then if the application continues to request sequential data records these can be read from the high speed memory on the cache rather than from the disk drive it follows that disk caching is most effective when an application for example loads a database file that is stored sequentially on the disk
0,caching techniques can be used in other ways for example most web browsers are set to store recently read pages on disk so that if the user directs the browser to go back to such a page it can be read from disk rather than having to be retransmitted over the internet generally a slower process web servers and isps such as cable services can also cache popular pages so they can be served up quickly
0,the final stage in the development of the calculator would be characterized by the use of electronics to replace mechanical or electromechanical action the use of logic 70 calculatorcircuits to perform calculations electronically was first seen in the giant computers of the late 1940s but this was obviously impractical for desktop office use by the late 1960s however transistorized calculators comparable in size to mechanical desktop calculators came into use by the 1970s the use of integrated circuits made it possible to shrink the calculator down to palm size and smaller these calculators use a microprocessor with a set of microinstructions that enable them to perform a repertoire of operations ranging from basic arithmetic to trigonometric statistical or business related function
0,development of automotive technology has tended to be incremental rather than revolutionary the core hardware such as the engine and drive train has changed little over several decades other than the replacement of carburetors with fuel injection systems and some improvements in areas such as brake design on the other hand there have been significant improvements in safety features such as seat belts air bags and improved crash absorption barriers in recent years however the incorporation of computers in automobile design has led to a number of significant advances in areas such as fuel efficiency traction stability crash response and driver information and navigation put simply cars are becoming smarter and are making driving easier and safer
0,much future progress in car computing will depend on creating integrated networking between vehicles and the road an advanced navigation system could take advantage of real time information being transmitted by the surrounding vehicles for example a stalled car would transmit warning messages to other drivers about the impending obstacle vehicles that sense an oil slick ice or other road hazard could also mark the location so it can be avoided by subsequent drivers data about the speed and spacing of traffic could provide real time information about traffic jams possibly routing vehicles into alternative lanes or other roads to reduce congestion and travel time
0,smart cars are vehicles equipped with advanced computing and communication technologies that enable them to collect analyze and share data to provide a wide range of features and services these technologies include advanced driver assistance systems adas smart cars are equipped with a variety of sensors and cameras that enable adas features such as lane departure warning automatic emergency braking adaptive cruise control and blind spot monitoring these features use computer algorithms to analyze data from the sensors and provide alerts or take action to prevent accidents connectivity smart cars are connected to the internet and other vehicles enabling them to share data about traffic conditions road hazards and weather conditions this connectivity also allows for over the air software updates remote diagnostics and other services infotainment smart cars offer advanced infotainment systems that provide features such as internet connectivity voice commands music streaming and navigation these systems are often integrated with the vehicle s adas features to provide real time information and alerts self driving some smart cars are capable of autonomous driving using a combination of sensors cameras and computer algorithms to navigate roads without human intervention these cars are still in development and are not yet widely available energy efficiency smart cars often use advanced technologies such as regenerative braking stop start systems and aerodynamic designs to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions
0,during the late 1950s and 1960s software rapidly grew more complex especially operating system software and large business applications with the typical program consisting of many components being developed by different programmers it became difficult both to see the big picture and to maintain consistent procedures for transferring data from one program module to another as computer scientists worked to develop sounder principles it also occurred to them that the power of the computer to automate procedures could be used to create tools for facilitating program design and managing the resulting complexity case or computer aided software engineering is a catchall phrase that covers a variety of such tools involved with all phases of development
0,the earliest design tool was the flowchart often drawn with the aid of a template that could be used to trace the symbols on paper with its symbols for the flow of execution through branching and looping the flowchart provides a good tool for visualizing how a program is intended to work however large and complex programs often result in a sea of flowcharts that are hard to relate to one another and to the program as a whole starting in the 1960s the creation of programs for manipulating flow symbols made it easier both to design flowcharts and to visualize them in varying levels of detail
0,once a program has been designed and implementation is under way case tools can help the programmers maintain consistency across their various modules one such tool now rather venerable is the data dictionary which is a database whose records contain information about the definition of data items and a list of program components that use each item when the definition of a data item is changed the data dictionary can provide a list of affected components database technology is also applied to software design in the creation of a database of objects within a particular program which can be used to provide more extensive information during debugging
0,analysis tools are computer software or web applications that are used to analyze data identify patterns and draw insights from large and complex datasets these tools are used by analysts researchers and data scientists to process and interpret data in order to make informed decisions and predictions some popular analysis tools include statistical analysis software these tools are used to perform statistical analysis on data such as hypothesis testing regression analysis and clustering examples include r sas and spss data visualization software these tools are used to create charts graphs and other visual representations of data in order to help users understand and communicate data insights examples include tableau power bi and qlikview business intelligence software these tools are used to analyze data from various sources such as sales data customer data and financial data in order to make informed business decisions examples include sap businessobjects ibm cognos and oracle business intelligence machine learning software these tools are used to train and deploy machine learning models in order to make predictions and automate decision making examples include tensorflow scikit learn and keras big data tools these tools are used to process and analyze large and complex datasets such as those generated by social media sensors and iot devices examples include apache hadoop spark and cassandra
0,in the late 1990s a new consumer technology enabled users to create their own cds with data or audio tracks the cheapest kind cd r compact disk recordable uses a layer of a dyed material and a thin gold layer to reflect the laser beam data is recorded by a laser beam hitting the dye layer in precise locations and marking it in one of several ways depending on technology the lengths of marked striped track and unmarked track together encode the data
0,the dvd alternatively digital video disc or digital versatile disc is similar to a cd but uses laser light with a shorter wavelength this means that the size of the pits and lands will be considerably smaller which in turns means that much more data can be stored on the same size disk a dvd disk typically stores up to 4 7 gb of data equivalent to about six cds this capacity can be doubled by using both sides of the disk the high capacity of dvd roms and their recordable equivalent dvd rams makes them useful for storing feature length movies or videos very large games and multimedia programs or large illustrated encyclopedias the development of high definition television hdtv standards spurred the introduction of higher capacity dvd formats the competition between sony s blu ray and hd dvd backed by toshiba and microsoft among others was resolved by 2008 in favor of the former bluray offers high capacity 25gb for single layer discs 50gb for dual layer
0,cellular automata theory has been applied to a variety of fields that deal with the complex interrelationships of components including biology microbe growth and population dynamics in general ecology including forestry and animal behavior such as the flight of birds the cues that a bird identifies in its neighbors are like the input conditions for a cell in a cellular automaton the output would be the bird s flight behavior the ability of cellular automatons to generate a rich complexity from simple components and rules mimics the development of life from simple components and thus cellular automation is an important tool in the creation and study of artificial life this can be furthered by combining a set of cellular automation rules with a geneticalgorithm including a mechanism for inheritance of characteristics cellular automation principles can also be applied to engineering in areas such as pattern or image recognition
0,governments have always to varying degrees concerned themselves with the content of public media the growing use of the internet for expressive activities has prompted authoritarian governments such as that of china to attempt to block objectionable material both through filtering techniques and through pressure on service providers further users identified as creators of banned content may be subjected to prosecution however because of the internet s decentralized structure and the ability of users to operate relatively anonymously internet censorship tends to be only partially effective in the democratic west internet censorship generally applies to only a few forms of content attempts to criminalize the online provision of pornography to minors in the 1996 communications decency act have generally been overturned by the courts as excessively infringing on the right of adults to access such content however a succession of bills seeking to require schools and libraries to install web filtering software culminated in the children s internet protection act which was upheld by the u s supreme court in 2003
0,by itself a web page coded in html is simply a static display that does not interact with the user other than for the selection of links see html dhtml and xhtm many web services including online databases and e commerce transactions require that the user be able to interact with the server for example an online shopper may need to browse or search a catalog of cd titles select one or more for purchase and then complete the transaction by providing credit card and other information these functions are provided by gateway programs on the server that can access databases or other facilities one way to provide interaction with and through a web page is to use the cgi common gateway interface cgi is a facility that allows web browsers and other client programs to link to and run programs stored on a web site the stored programs called scripts can be written in various languages such as javascript or php and placed in a cgi bin folder on the web server the cgi script is referenced by an html hyperlink on the web page such as a href myserver com cgi bin myscript myscript a
0,while the attention of the first computer designers focused mainly on numeric calculations it was clear that much of the data that business people and others would want to manipulate with the new machines would be textual in nature billing records for example would have to include customer names and addresses not just balance totals the natural representation of data in a computer is as a series of two state binary values interpreted as binary numbers the solution for representing text letters of the alphabet punctuation marks and other special symbols is to assign a numeric value to each text symbol the result is a character code such as ascii american standard code for information interchange which is the scheme used most widely today another system ebcdic extended binary coded decimal interchange code was used during the heyday of ibm mainframes but is seldom used today
0,sophisticated string processing such as parsing and pattern matching tends to be awkward to express in traditional number oriented programming languages several languages have been designed especially for manipulating textual data snobol designed in the early 1960s is best 82 characters and stringsknown for its sophisticated pattern matching and pattern processing capabilities a similar language icon is widely used for specialized string processing tasks today many programmers working with textual data in the unix environment have found that the awk and perl languages are easier to use than c for extracting and manipulating data fields see awk and perl
0,many pc users have become acquainted with chatting through participating in chat rooms operated by online services such as america online aol a chat room is a virtual space in which people meet either to socialize generally or to discuss particular topics at their best chat rooms can develop into true communities whose participants develop long term friendships and provide one another with information and emotional support however the essentially anonymous character of chat where participants often use handles rather than real names that facilitates freedom of expression can also provide a cover for mischief or even crime chat rooms have acquired a rather lurid reputation in the eyes of the general public there has been considerable public concern about children becoming involved in inappropriate sexual conversation this has been fueled by media stories sometimes exaggerated about children being recruited into face toface meetings with pedophiles aol and other online services have tried to reduce such activity by restricting online sex chat to adults but there is no reliable mechanism for a service to verify its user s age a chat room can also be supervised by a host or moderator who tries to prevent flaming insults or other behavior that the online service considers to be inappropriate
0,for people who find commercial online services to be too expensive or confining there are alternatives available for just the cost of an internet connection the popular internet relay chat irc was developed in finland by jarkko oikarinen in the late 1980s using one of the freely available client programs users connect to an irc server which in turn is connected to one of dozens of irc networks users can create their own chat rooms called channels there are thousands of irc channels with participants all over the world to participate a user simply joins a channel and sees all messages currently being posted by other users of the channel in turn the user s messages are posted for all to see while irc uses only text there are now enhanced chat systems often written in java to work with a web browser that add graphics and other features there are many other technologies that can be used for conversing via the internet some chat services such as cu seeme enable participants to transmit their images voice can also be transmitted over an internet connection for a very pervasive form of ad hoc textual communication see texting and instant messaging
0,the famous turing test proposes that if a human is unable to reliably distinguish messages from a computer from those of another person the computer program involved can at least be provisionally declared to be intelligent the advent of textual communication via the internet has afforded a variety of ways to attempt to meet this challenge programs that mimic human conversational styles have come to be known as chatterbots the prototypical chatterbot was eliza developed by joseph weizenbaum in the mid 1960s eliza mimicked a form of nondirective psychotherapy in which the therapist echoes or plays off of the client s statements as a form of gentle encouragement and validation thus if one types my father didn t really like me eliza might reply tell me more about your father although primitive eliza once inadvertently fooled an executive into thinking he was exchanging messages with weizenbaum other classic chatterbots include parry designed to mimic a paranoid and the story generating racter
0,with simple rules but endless permutations chess has fascinated millions of players for hundreds of years when mechanical automatons became fashionable in the 18th century onlookers were intrigued by the turk a chessplaying automaton while the turk was eventually shown to be a hoax a human player was hidden inside the development of the electronic digital computer in the mid 20th century provided the opportunity to create a true automatic chess player in 1950 claude shannon outlined the two basic strategies that would be used by future chess playing programs the brute force strategy would examine the possible moves for the computer chess player the possible replies of the opponent to each move the possible next moves by the computer and so on for as many half moves or plies as possible the moves would be evaluated by a minimax algorithm that would find the move that best improves the computer s position despite the opponent s best play
0,the earliest computer chess theorists such as claude shannon and alan turing saw the game as one potential way to demonstrate true machine intelligence ironically by the time computers had truly mastered chess the artificial intelligence ai community had concluded that mastering the game was largely irrelevant to their goals ai pioneers herbert simon and john mccarthy have referred to chess as the drosophila of ai by this they mean that like the ubiquitous fruit flies in genetics research chess became an easy way to measure computer prowess but what was it measuring the dominant brute force approach was more a measure of computing power than the application of such ai techniques as pattern recognition there is however still some interest in writing chess programs that think more like a human player in recent years there has been some interest in programming computers to play the asian board game go where positional and structural elements play a greater role than in chess however even the latest generation of go programs seem to be relying more on a statistical approach than a deep conceptual analysis
0,in personal computers a chipset is a group of integrated circuits that together perform a particular function system purchasers generally think in terms of the processor itself such as a pentium iii pentium iv or competitive chips from amd or cyrix however they are really buying a system chipset that includes the microprocessor itself and often a memory cache which may be part of the microprocessor or a separate chip see cache as well as the chips that control the memory bus which connects the processor to the main memory on the motherboard see bus the overall performance of the system depends not just on the processor s architecture including data width instruction set and use of instruction pipelines but also on the type and size of the cache memory the memory bus rdram or rambus and sdram and the speed with which the processor can move data to and from memory in addition to the system chipset other chipsets on the motherboard are used to support functions such as graphics the agp or advanced graphics port for example drive connection eide controller communication with external devices and connections to expansion cards the pci bus

0,a class is a data type that combines both a data structure and methods for manipulating the data for example a string class might consist of an array to hold the characters in the string and methods to compare strings combine strings or extract portions of a string as with other data types once a class is declared objects sometimes called instances of the class can be created and used this way of structuring programs is called object oriented programming because the class object is the basic building block object oriented programming and classes provide several advantages over traditional block structured languages in a traditional basic or even pascal program there is no particular connection between the data structure and the procedures or functions that manipulate it in a large program one programmer might change the data structure without alerting other programmers whose code assumes the original structure on the other hand someone might write a procedure that directly manipulates the internal data rather than using the methods already provided either transgression can lead to hard to find bugs
0,it is often more efficient to have a large relatively expensive computer provide an application or service to users on many smaller inexpensive computers that are linked to it by a network connection the term server can apply to both the application providing the service and the machine running it the program or machine that receives the service is called the client a familiar example is browsing the web the user runs a web browser which is a client program the browser connects to the web server that hosts the desired web site another example is a corporate server that runs a database users client programs connect to the database over a local area network lan many retail transactions are also handled using a client server arrangement thus when a travel or theater booking agent sells a ticket the agent s client program running on a pc or terminal connects to the server containing the database that keeps track of what seats are available
0,there are several advantages to using the client server model having most of the processing done by one or more servers means that these powerful and more costly machines can be used to the greatest efficiency if more processing capacity is needed more servers can be brought online without having to revamp the whole system users on the other hand only need pcs or terminals that are powerful enough to run the smaller client program to connect to the server keeping the data in a central location helps ensure its integrity if a database is on a server transactions can be committed in an orderly way to ensure that for example the same ticket isn t sold to two people a client server model also offers flexibility to users any client program that meets the standards supported by the server can be used to make a connection
0,the transfer of data within the microprocessor and between the microprocessor and memory must be synchronized to ensure that the data needed to execute each instruction is available when the flow of execution has reached an appropriate point this synchronization is accomplished by moving data in intervals that correspond to the pulses of the system clock a quartz crystal this is done by sending control signals that tell the components of the processor and memory when to send or wait for data thus if the microprocessor is the heart of the computer the clock is the heart s pacemaker because most devices cannot run at the same pace as the processor circuits in various parts of the motherboard create secondary control signals that run at various ratios of the actual system clock speed
0,common business oriented language was developed under the impetus of a 1959 department of defense initiative to create a common language for developing business applications that centered on the processing of data from files the military after all was a business whose inventory control and accounting needs dwarfed those of all but the largest corporations at the time the principal business oriented language for mainframe computers was flow matic a language developed by grace hopper s team at remingtonrand univac and limited to that company s computers the first cobol compilers became available in 1960 and the american national standards institute ansi issued a standard specification for the language in 1968 expanded standards were issued in 1974 and 1985 cobol 74 and cobol 85 with a new standard issued in 2002
0,short for coder decoder a codec is essentially an algorithm for encoding and compressing a stream of data for transmission and then decoding and decompressing it at the receiving end usually the data involved represents audio or video content typically the data is being downloaded from a web site to be played on a personal computer or portable player a codec is described as lossy if some of the original information is lost in the compression process it then becomes a question of whether the loss in quality is perceived by the user as significant a codec that preserves all the information needed to re create the original file is lossless for most purposes the much greater size of the lossless version of a file is not worth the often imperceptible increase in quality or fidelity a codec is usually used in connection with a container format that specifies how the encoded data is to be stored in a file often a container can hold more than one data stream and even more than one kind of media such as video and audio when one refers to a windows wav file for example one is actually referring to a container
0,cognitive science is the study of mental processes such as reasoning memory and the processing of perception it is necessarily an interdisciplinary approach that includes fields such as psychology linguistics and neurology the importance of the computer to cognitive science is that it offers a potential nonhuman model for a thinking entity the attempts at artificial intelligence over the past 50 years have used the insights of cognitive science to help devise artificial means of reasoning and perception at the same time the models created by computer scientists such as the neural network and marvin minsky s idea of multiple intelligent agents have in turn been applied to the study of human cognition
0,with the exception of a few experimental systems color graphics first became widely available only with the beginnings of desktop computers in the late 1970s the first microcomputers were able to display only a few colors some indeed displayed only monochrome or grayscale today s pc video hardware has the potential to display millions of colors though of course the human eye cannot directly distinguish colors that are too close together there are several important schemes that are used to define a color space that is a range of values that can be associated with physical colors
0,one of the simplest color systems displays colors as varying intensities of red green and blue this corresponds to the electronics of a standard color computer monitor which uses three electron guns that bombard red green and blue phosphors on the screen a typical rgb color scheme uses 8 bits to store each of the red green and blue components for each pixel for a total of 24 bits 16 777 216 colors the 32 bit color system provides the same number of colors but includes 8 bits for alpha or the level of transparency the number of bits per pixel is also called the bit depth or color depth
0,cmyk stands for cyan magenta yellow and black this four component color system is standard for most types of color printing since black is an ink color in printing but is simply the absence of color in video one of the more difficult tasks to be performed by desktop publishing software is to properly match a given rgb screen color to the corresponding cmyk print color recent versions of microsoft windows and the macintosh operating system include a cms color matching system to support color matching
0,although most color schemes now support thousands or millions of colors it would be wasteful and inefficient to use three or four bytes to store the color of each pixel in memory after all any given application is likely to need only a few dozen colors the solution is to set up a palette which is a table of usually 256 color values currently in use by the program a palette is also sometimes called a clut or color lookup table the color of each pixel can then be stored as an index to the corresponding value in the palette
0,portability is the ability to adapt software or hardware to a wide variety of platforms that is computer systems or operating systems developers want their products to be portable so they can adapt to an often rapidly changing marketplace a typical strategy for portability is to choose a language that is in widespread use and a compiler that is certified as meeting the ansi or other standard for the language the program should be written in such a way that it makes as few assumptions as possible about hardwaredependent matters such as how data is stored in memory it is also sometimes possible to use standard frameworks that provide the same functions in several different operating systems such as windows macintosh and unix
0,a compiler is a program that takes as input a program written in a source language and produces as output an equivalent program written in another target language usually the input program is in a high level language such as c and the output is in assembly language for the target machine compilers are useful because programming directly in low level machine instructions as had to be done with the first computers is tedious and prone to errors use of assembly language helps somewhat by allowing substitution of symbols variable names for memory locations and the use of mnemonic names for operations such as add for addition rather than some binary instruction code an assembler is essentially a compiler that needs to make only relatively simple translations because assembly language is still at a relatively low level
0,compilers are traditionally thought of as having a front end that analyzes the source code high level language statements and a back end that generates the appropriate low level code the front end processing begins with lexical analysis the compiler scans the source program looking for matches to valid tokens as defined by the language a token is any word or symbol that has meaning in the language such as a keyword reserved word such as if or while next the tokens are parsed or grouped according to the rules of the language the result of parsing is a parse tree that resolves statements into their component parts for example an assignment statement may be parsed into an identifier an assignment operator such as and a value to be assigned the value in turn may be an arithmetic expression that consists of operators and operands
0,the process of code generation usually involves multiple passes that gradually substitute machine specific code and data for the information in the parse tree an important consideration in modern compilers is optimization which is the process of substituting equivalent but more efficient constructs for the original output of the front end for example an optimizer can replace an arithmetic expression with its value so that it need not be repeatedly calculated while the program is running it can also hoist out an invariant expression from a loop so that it is calculated only once before the loop begins on a larger scale optimization can also improve the communication between different parts procedures of the program the compiler must attempt to prove that the change it is making in the program will never cause the program to operate incorrectly it can do this for example by tracing the possible paths of execution through the program such as through branching and loops and verifying that each possible path yields the correct result a compiler that is too aggressive in making assumptions can produce subtle program errors many compilers allow the user to control the level of optimization and whether to optimize for speed or for compactness of program size during development a compiler is often set to include special debugging code in the output this code preserves potentially important information that can help the debugging facility better identify program bugs after the program is working correctly it will be recompiled without the debugging code
1,nlp or natural language processing is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence that focuses on the interactions between computers and human language specifically nlp aims to develop algorithms and techniques that enable computers to analyze understand and generate natural language the goal of nlp is to enable computers to perform a range of language related tasks such as text translation sentiment analysis speech recognition chatbot development and text summarization among others nlp involves the use of techniques from linguistics computer science and statistics among other fields to enable machines to process and analyze large volumes of human language data nlp is a rapidly evolving field that has seen significant advancements in recent years thanks in large part to advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence as a result nlp has become increasingly important in a wide range of industries including healthcare finance e commerce and marketing among others
1,there are many applications of nlp across various industries and fields some of the most common applications of nlp include text analysis and classification nlp can be used to classify and analyze large volumes of text data such as emails social media posts and customer reviews sentiment analysis nlp can be used to analyze the sentiment of text data such as whether a customer review is positive or negative speech recognition nlp can be used to transcribe spoken language into text which can be used for a variety of purposes including voice assistants and customer service chatbots machine translation nlp can be used to translate text from one language to another enabling communication across language barriers chatbots and virtual assistants nlp can be used to develop chatbots and virtual assistants that can communicate with users in natural language answering questions and providing assistance content generation nlp can be used to generate text content such as news articles or product descriptions based on input data text summarization nlp can be used to summarize large volumes of text data such as news articles or research papers into shorter summaries named entity recognition nlp can be used to identify and extract information about named entities such as people places and organizations from text data these are just a few examples of the many applications of nlp which has a wide range of potential uses across numerous industries and fields
1,netiquette is a term used to describe the proper etiquette and behavior expected from individuals when communicating and interacting with others online it involves adhering to certain rules and guidelines to ensure that online communication is respectful courteous and effective some examples of netiquette include using appropriate language and avoiding offensive or discriminatory language avoiding all caps and excessive use of exclamation marks as it can come across as shouting being mindful of other people s time when sending emails or messages respecting others privacy and not sharing their personal information without their consent and refraining from spamming or sending unsolicited messages netiquette is important as it helps to create a positive and respectful online environment and ensures that people are able to communicate effectively and productively with each other online by following netiquette guidelines individuals can also avoid misunderstandings conflicts and potentially harmful or offensive behavior
1,chuq von rospach is a well known author and speaker on the topic of netiquette network etiquette in his writing he has suggested a number of guidelines for good online behavior here are some of his suggestions respect others this means treating other people with respect and avoiding insults flaming or other forms of aggressive or hurtful behavior be concise when posting messages online try to be brief and to the point avoid rambling or going off topic stay on topic when participating in online discussions try to keep your contributions relevant to the topic at hand use appropriate language avoid using profanity or other offensive language and be mindful of the fact that people from different backgrounds and cultures may be reading your posts be aware of privacy issues respect people s privacy by not sharing personal information about them without their consent use good manners remember to say please and thank you when appropriate and avoid interrupting others be forgiving people sometimes make mistakes online try to be forgiving and give others the benefit of the doubt overall chuq von rospach s suggestions for netiquette are designed to promote respectful constructive online communication by following these guidelines we can create a more positive and productive online community
1,advocates of net neutrality argue that all internet traffic should be treated equally without discrimination or preference given to any particular website or online service specifically they argue that internet service providers isps should not be allowed to block slow down or otherwise manipulate internet traffic based on the content or source of that traffic here are some of the key arguments made by advocates of net neutrality protecting free speech net neutrality ensures that all voices on the internet have an equal opportunity to be heard if isps are allowed to block or slow down certain websites or services this could restrict the ability of some individuals or groups to communicate online promoting innovation without net neutrality isps could potentially favor their own products or services over those of their competitors this could stifle innovation and limit consumer choice preventing discrimination net neutrality ensures that all internet traffic is treated equally regardless of the content source or destination of that traffic this prevents isps from engaging in discriminatory practices that could harm certain groups or individuals supporting small businesses net neutrality ensures that small businesses have an equal opportunity to reach customers online without net neutrality larger companies could potentially pay isps for faster internet access giving them an unfair advantage over smaller competitors overall advocates of net neutrality argue that this principle is essential for protecting free speech promoting innovation preventing discrimination and supporting a level playing field for all online businesses and individuals
1,newsgroups emerged in the early days of the internet as a way for people to communicate and share information with each other the development of newsgroups can be traced back to the 1970s when the first email systems were created at that time email was used primarily by academics and researchers who used it to share information and collaborate on projects in the late 1970s a new communication protocol called usenet was developed which allowed people to post and read messages in public discussion forums called newsgroups usenet was decentralized meaning that anyone with an internet connection could participate in discussions and post messages in newsgroups on a wide range of topics as the internet grew in popularity in the 1990s so did the number of people using newsgroups at their peak there were tens of thousands of newsgroups covering a wide range of topics from politics and religion to sports and entertainment some newsgroups were moderated by volunteers who ensured that discussions remained civil and on topic while others were unmoderated and often became heated and contentious in the late 1990s and early 2000s the popularity of newsgroups began to wane as other forms of online communication such as social media and instant messaging emerged however newsgroups continue to exist today albeit with much smaller user bases than in their heyday many newsgroups have migrated to web forums or email discussion lists but the basic idea of public discussion forums where people can share information and ideas lives on
1,netnews also known as usenet is a distributed online discussion system that allows users to read and post messages in public discussion forums called newsgroups each newsgroup is dedicated to a specific topic and users can browse search and participate in discussions related to that topic here are the key features and structures of netnews and newsgroups hierarchy newsgroups are organized into a hierarchical structure that starts with major categories such as comp for computer related discussions sci for science related discussions soc for social discussions and rec for recreational discussions each major category is further divided into subcategories that reflect more specific topics message posting users can post messages to newsgroups by composing a message in their newsreader software and submitting it to a news server the message is then distributed to all servers that subscribe to that particular newsgroup message threading netnews uses a threading system that groups related messages together in a tree like structure users can easily follow the conversation by viewing messages in the order they were posted and seeing how they relate to each other subscription users can subscribe to newsgroups that interest them and their newsreader software will download all new messages in those newsgroups automatically moderation some newsgroups are moderated by volunteers who review messages before they are posted to ensure they are relevant and appropriate for the newsgroup s topic moderators can also remove messages that violate the group s rules archives netnews messages are archived on news servers and users can search through archives to find old messages or topics of interest distribution netnews messages are distributed across a network of news servers which synchronize with each other to ensure that all messages are available to all users in summary netnews and newsgroups offer a decentralized distributed system for online discussion and information sharing with a hierarchical structure message threading subscriptions and archives while netnews and newsgroups have been largely superseded by other online communication platforms they remain an important part of the early history of the internet and online communities
1,netnews or usenet is a distributed system for exchanging news and information in the form of messages posted to newsgroups the system is decentralized meaning that there is no central server or authority that controls it instead messages are distributed across a network of interconnected servers which synchronize with each other to ensure that all messages are available to all users here s how the distribution and reading of netnews works posting a message users can post messages to a newsgroup by composing a message in their newsreader software and submitting it to their local news server the message is then propagated to other servers that subscribe to the newsgroup until it reaches all servers in the network replication and synchronization each news server stores a copy of all messages it receives and periodically synchronizes with other servers to exchange new messages and updates this ensures that all servers have the same set of messages and that users can access the latest messages from any server in the network reading messages users can browse newsgroups and read messages using their newsreader software the software retrieves messages from their local news server and can also retrieve messages from other servers in the network if the local server does not have a copy of a particular message message threading netnews uses a threading system to group related messages together in a tree like structure based on their subject and message id this makes it easy for users to follow a conversation or track the evolution of a discussion over time archiving messages are typically archived on news servers and can be accessed by users even after they have been removed from their local server or the server they were originally posted to this allows users to search for and access older messages and discussions overall the distribution and reading of netnews is based on a decentralized peer to peer system that relies on the synchronization and replication of messages across a network of servers this allows users to access a wide range of topics and discussions from anywhere in the network while also ensuring that messages are distributed and stored redundantly to prevent loss or corruption
1,the idea of networks has been around for centuries as people have always sought ways to connect with each other over long distances however the modern computer network as we know it today began to take shape in the mid 20th century in the 1950s computers were large expensive and rare machines that were primarily used by governments large corporations and academic institutions these computers were often housed in large rooms or buildings and were operated by trained technicians one of the earliest computer networks was the sage semi automatic ground environment system which was developed in the late 1950s by the united states air force the sage system was designed to provide early warning of potential air attacks by the soviet union it used a network of interconnected computers to track incoming enemy aircraft and coordinate defensive responses in the 1960s the us department of defense developed the arpanet which was the first wide area network to use packet switching the arpanet was initially designed as a way for researchers at different universities and research institutions to share computing resources and collaborate on research projects over the years computer networks evolved and became more sophisticated eventually leading to the creation of the world wide web in the 1990s today networks are an essential part of our daily lives connecting people and devices all over the world and enabling us to access information and services instantly from almost anywhere
1,the osi open systems interconnection model is a conceptual model that describes the communication process between computing systems it is composed of seven layers each of which defines a specific function in the communication process the layers are physical layer this layer is responsible for transmitting raw data between devices using physical connections like cables wires or radio signals it defines the electrical and physical specifications for the connection data link layer this layer is responsible for transmitting data between devices on the same physical network it defines how data is organized into frames for transmission and how errors are detected and corrected network layer this layer is responsible for routing data between different networks it determines the optimal path for data to travel and uses protocols like ip internet protocol to transmit data between networks transport layer this layer provides reliable end to end communication between devices it breaks down data into smaller packets for transmission and ensures that they are received correctly at the other end session layer this layer establishes manages and terminates connections between devices it allows applications on different devices to establish a communication session and manage the exchange of data presentation layer this layer is responsible for data representation and encryption it transforms data into a format that can be understood by the application layer and encrypts it for secure transmission application layer this layer provides services to end users such as email file transfer and web browsing it defines the protocols and formats used by applications to communicate with each other the osi model is a reference model and does not specify any particular protocol or technology however it provides a common framework that helps network designers and developers to understand the various functions and interactions between different layers of the network
1,nas stands for network attached storage it refers to a storage device that is connected to a network and allows multiple users and devices to access and share files and data over that network nas devices typically have their own operating systems and can provide a wide range of features such as file sharing backup and recovery media streaming and remote access nas devices can be used in both home and business settings to centralize and manage data storage across multiple devices and users they are often used as a more cost effective and flexible alternative to traditional file servers which require dedicated hardware and it support nas devices can range in size from small single drive units to large enterprise level systems with multiple drives and advanced features
1,a storage area network san is a dedicated high speed network that provides block level access to data storage in a san storage devices such as disk arrays tape libraries and other storage appliances are connected to servers through a series of switches and or hubs sans are designed to provide high speed reliable access to large amounts of data and are often used in enterprise environments where large amounts of data need to be stored and accessed by multiple servers and applications sans provide centralized storage management which allows administrators to allocate storage resources to servers and applications as needed sans typically use fibre channel or iscsi protocols to connect storage devices to the network fibre channel is a high speed dedicated network technology that provides very low latency and high reliability iscsi on the other hand is an ip based protocol that allows storage devices to be connected to the network using standard ethernet connections sans can provide a number of benefits including increased performance scalability and availability of data they are often used in data centers and other large scale it environments to provide high performance storage for critical applications and data
1,cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction that typically focuses on a future dystopian society dominated by advanced technology and corporate control the term was first used in the 1980s to describe a type of science fiction that features a gritty urban setting high tech weaponry and a distinct anti authoritarian attitude the central themes of cyberpunk often include a focus on the dangers of technology and the impact of artificial intelligence virtual reality and cybernetic enhancements on human society it often explores themes of social decay economic inequality and the struggle of individuals to find their place in a complex and oppressive world some well known examples of cyberpunk include william gibson s neuromancer bruce sterling s schismatrix and the movies blade runner and the matrix cyberpunk has also influenced other media such as video games music and fashion
1,neuroprosthetics is a field of study that involves developing devices that can replace or restore the function of the nervous system these devices are designed to interface directly with the brain spinal cord or peripheral nerves and can be used to restore movement sensation or other functions that may have been lost due to injury or disease at duke university researchers have been working on developing advanced neuroprosthetics that can help people with spinal cord injuries regain movement and mobility one of the key areas of focus has been on developing brain machine interfaces bmis that can translate brain activity into movement in a recent study published in the journal nature medicine researchers at duke university demonstrated that a monkey with a spinal cord injury was able to regain the ability to walk with the help of a brain controlled robotic exoskeleton the monkey had electrodes implanted in its brain that were able to decode signals related to movement and translate them into commands that controlled the robotic exoskeleton the researchers also used a wireless connection to send feedback from the exoskeleton back to the monkey s brain which allowed it to adjust its movements in real time this approach has the potential to enable people with spinal cord injuries to regain movement and independence overall the research carried out at duke university and other institutions in the field of neuroprosthetics is aimed at developing new and innovative approaches to restoring function and improving the quality of life for people with neurological disorders or injuries

1,integers are typically stored in memory as binary digits or bits which are either a 0 or a 1 the size of the integer i e the number of bits used to represent it can vary depending on the programming language and the computer architecture being used in most modern computers integers are typically stored using a fixed number of bits such as 8 bits 16 bits 32 bits or 64 bits the number of bits used to represent an integer determines its range of possible values for example an 8 bit integer can represent values between 0 and 255 while a 32 bit integer can represent values between 2 147 483 648 and 2 147 483 647 when an integer is stored in memory it is typically stored as a binary representation of the integer s value using a fixed number of bits the most significant bit msb represents the sign of the integer positive or negative while the remaining bits represent the magnitude of the integer for example consider the 8 bit integer 23 in binary this value is represented as 11101001 the leftmost bit 1 represents the sign negative while the remaining 7 bits 1101001 represent the magnitude of the integer 23 when this value is stored in memory the computer will reserve 8 bits of memory and store the binary value 11101001 at the corresponding memory address
1,floating point numbers are typically stored in memory using a standardized format such as the ieee 754 standard this format uses a combination of a sign bit an exponent and a mantissa to represent the value of the floating point number the sign bit indicates whether the value is positive or negative it is represented using a single bit with 0 indicating a positive value and 1 indicating a negative value the exponent represents the power of 2 by which the mantissa should be multiplied it is represented using a fixed number of bits which depends on the specific floating point format being used for example in single precision floating point format which uses 32 bits the exponent is represented using 8 bits the mantissa represents the significant digits of the floating point number it is also represented using a fixed number of bits which depends on the specific floating point format being used in single precision floating point format the mantissa is represented using 23 bits to store a floating point number in memory the computer first converts the number to the standardized floating point format using the appropriate number of bits for the sign exponent and mantissa the resulting binary representation is then stored in memory at a specific memory address when a program needs to use the floating point number it reads the binary representation from memory converts it back to the original floating point value and performs the necessary calculations
1,in object oriented programming inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class inheriting its properties and methods to illustrate this concept with an example we can use the microsoft windows dialog box a dialog box is a graphical user interface element that displays information to the user and prompts them for a response in microsoft windows a dialog box is implemented as a class which we can call the dialogbox class now let s suppose we want to create a new type of dialog box called a colorpickerdialogbox that allows the user to pick a color we can use inheritance to create this new class based on the dialogbox class the colorpickerdialogbox class will inherit all the properties and methods of the dialogbox class such as the ability to display text buttons and input fields however the colorpickerdialogbox class will also have its own unique properties and methods that are specific to picking colors such as a color palette and color preview box by using inheritance we can avoid duplicating code and make our program more efficient and easier to maintain we can also create more specialized classes that build upon existing classes making our code more modular and extensible
1,polymorphism is a concept in object oriented programming that allows different objects to be treated as if they were the same type it allows code to be more flexible and reusable by allowing different objects to be used interchangeably to illustrate this concept with an example let s consider a program that deals with different shapes such as circles squares and triangles each shape has its own unique properties and methods such as its size color and the ability to calculate its perimeter now let s suppose we want to create a method that takes a shape object as input and calculates its perimeter we can use polymorphism to create a single method that works for all types of shapes rather than creating separate methods for each shape

1,selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the smallest element from the unsorted part of an array and moving it to the beginning of the array the algorithm maintains two subarrays the sorted subarray which starts as empty and the unsorted subarray which starts as the entire array the algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted subarray and swapping it with the first element in the unsorted subarray this effectively moves the smallest element to the beginning of the array and expands the sorted subarray by one element the algorithm then repeats this process for the remainder of the unsorted subarray until the entire array is sorted in each step of the algorithm the smallest element in the unsorted subarray is identified and swapped with the first element in the unsorted subarray after four steps the array is sorted in ascending order selection sort has a time complexity of o n 2 which makes it inefficient for large arrays however it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or as a building block for more complex sorting algorithms
1,bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through an array of elements and compares adjacent elements swapping them if they are in the wrong order the algorithm continues to iterate through the array until no more swaps are necessary indicating that the array is sorted in each step of the algorithm the current element is compared with the next element and swapped if they are in the wrong order the algorithm continues to iterate through the array until no more swaps are necessary indicating that the array is sorted bubble sort has a time complexity of o n 2 which makes it inefficient for large arrays however it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or as a building block for more complex sorting algorithms
1,quick sort is a widely used sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer strategy to sort an array of elements the algorithm works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two subarrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot the pivot element is then placed between the two subarrays the partitioning process is repeated recursively on each of the subarrays until the entire array is sorted the two subarrays are sorted independently using quick sort quick sort has a time complexity of o n log n in the average case and o n 2 in the worst case however it is generally faster than other sorting algorithms for large arrays due to its efficient use of memory and cache it is widely used in practice and is often the sorting algorithm of choice for many programming languages and applications
1,insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time the algorithm iterates through the array and at each iteration it takes the current element and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted subarray to the left of it the algorithm maintains two subarrays the sorted subarray which starts as the first element of the array and the unsorted subarray which starts as the remaining elements of the array in each step of the algorithm the current element in the unsorted subarray is compared with the elements in the sorted subarray until its correct position is found the elements in the sorted subarray that are greater than the current element are shifted one position to the right to make room for the current element the current element is then inserted into its correct position in the sorted subarray insertion sort has a time complexity of o n 2 which makes it inefficient for large arrays however it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or for sorting partially sorted arrays it is also an efficient algorithm for sorting small datasets or for use as a sub routine in more complex algorithms
1,in hash based sorting algorithms a hash table is used to store the elements to be sorted the keys of the hash table are computed from the values of the elements using a hash function the values stored in the hash table can be either the elements themselves or pointers to the elements the elements are then sorted by iterating through the hash table and collecting the values in order since hash tables do not maintain any order on their own the order of the elements collected from the hash table must be determined based on the order of the hash keys in some cases a secondary sorting algorithm may be used to sort the values with the same hash key one advantage of hash based sorting algorithms is that they can achieve linear time complexity in the average case since hash table operations such as insertion and lookup can be performed in constant time on average however the worst case time complexity is typically higher than other sorting algorithms since collisions in the hash table can lead to slower performance

0,in turn when messages arrive at a major node from another region they are distributed to all the smaller sites that share the newsfeed
0,due to the volume of groups and messages many sites now choose to receive only a subset of the total newsfeed
0,sites also determine when messages will expire and thus be removed from the site
0,there are dozens of different news reading programs that can be used to view the available newsgroups and postings
0,on unix systems programs such as elm and tin are popular while other newsreaders cater to windows macintosh and other systems
0,major web browsers such as netscape and internet explorer offer simplified news reading features
0,to use these news readers the user accesses a newsfeed at an address provided by the internet service provider isp
0,there are also services that let users simply navigate through the news system by following the links on a web page
0,the former service called dejanews now google groups is the best known and most complete such site
0,in the 1940s the main objective in developing the first digital computers was to speed up the process of calculation
0,in the 1950s the machines began to be used for more general data processing tasks by governments and business
0,by the 1960s computers were in use in most major academic government and business organizations
0,the desire for users to share data and to communicate both within and outside their organization led to efforts to link computers together into networks
0,computer manufacturers began to develop proprietary networking software to link their computers but they were limited to a particular kind of computer such as a dec pdp minicomputer or an ibm mainframe
0,however the u s defense department seeing the need for a robust decentralized network that could maintain links between their computers under wartime conditions funded the development of a protocol that given appropriate hardware to bridge the gap could link these disparate networks
0,according to the osi open systems interconnection model a network can be considered to be a series of seven layers laid one atop another
0,the physical layer is at the bottom
0,it specifies the physical connections between the computers which can be anything from ordinary phone lines to cable fiber optic or wireless
0,this layer specifies the required electrical characteristics such as voltage changes and durations that constitute the physical signal that is recognized as either a 1 or 0 in the bit stream
0,the next layer called the data link layer specifies how data will be grouped into chunks of bits frames or packets and how transmission errors will be dealt with
0,the network layer groups the data frames as parts of a properly formed data packet and routes that packet from the sending node to the specified destination node
0,a variety of routing algorithms can be used to determine the most efficient route given current traffic or line conditions
0,the transport layer views the packets as part of a complete transmission of an object such as a web page and ensures that all the packets belonging to that object are sorted into their original sequence at the destination
0,this is necessary because packets belonging to the same message may be sent via different routes in keeping with traffic or line conditions
0,the session layer provides application programs communicating over the network with the ability to initiate terminate or restart an interrupted data transfer
0,the presentation layer ensures that data formats are consistent so that all applications know what to expect
0,this layer can also provide special services
0,finally the application layer gives applications highlevel commands for performing tasks over the network such as file transfer protocol ftp
0,a network attached storage nas unit can be thought of as a dedicated data storage unit that is available to all users of a network
0,unlike a traditional dedicated file storage unit a nas unit typically has an operating system and software designed specifically and only for providing data storage services
0,the actual storage is usually provided by an array of hard drives
0,files on the nas are accessed through protocols such as smb server message block common on windows networks and nfs network file system used on many unix and some linux networks
0,in recent years smaller lower cost nas devices have become available for smaller networks including home networks where they can store music video and other files
0,although it sounds similar a storage area network san does not function as its own file server
0,rather it attaches storage modules such as hard drives or tape libraries to an existing server so that it appears to the server s operating system as though it were locally attached
0,typically the protocol used to attach the storage is scsi but the physical connection is fiber or high speed ethernet
0,the emphasis for san applications is the need for fast access to data such as in large online databases e mail servers and high volume file servers
0,sans offer great flexibility since storage can be expanded without changing the network structure and a replacement server can quickly be attached to the storage in case of hardware failure
0,in the kind of science fiction sometimes called cyberpunk people are able to jack in or connect their brains directly tocomputer networks
0,because of this direct input into the brain or perhaps the optic and other sensory nerves a personwho is jacked in experiences the virtual world as fully real and can depending on the world s rules manipulate it withhis or her mind
0,this kind of all immersive virtual reality isstill science fiction but today people are beginning to controlcomputers and artificial limbs directly with their minds
0,neuroprosthetics is the creation of artificial limbs or sensoryorgans that are directly connected to the nervous system
0,the first and most widely used example is the cochlearimplant which can restore hearing by taking sound signals from a microphone and converting them to electricalimpulses that directly stimulate auditory nerves within thecochlea a part of the inner ear
0,similarly experimental retinal implants that stimulate optic nerves are beginning tooffer crude but useful vision to certain blind patients
0,research in connecting the brain to artificial arms orlegs is still in its early stages but scientists using microelectrode arrays have been able to record signals from thebrain s neurons and correlate them to different types ofmotor movements
0,in a series of experiments at duke university researchers first trained a monkey to operate a joystick to move a shape in a video game
0,they then recordedand analyzed the signals produced by the monkey s brainwhile playing the game and correlated them with themotor movements in the joystick
0,next they replicatedthese movements with a robotic arm as the monkey movedthe joystick
0,finally they were able to train the monkey tomove the robotic arm without using the joystick at all simply by thinking about the movements
0,as more is learned about the detailed functioning of neuronal networks inside the brain cognitive prosthetics maybecome feasible
0,one example might be computer memory modules that might act as a surrogate or extension ofhuman memory perhaps helping compensate for loss ofmemory due to age or disease
0,early experiments on interfacing to the hippocampus a part of the brain important forforming memories have been underway since 2003
0,other possibilities might include processors that couldgive a person the ability to think about a mathematicalproblem and see the answer or to search databases or theweb simply by visualizing or thinking about the information desired
0,integers whole numbers have the simplest representation but there are two important considerations the totalnumber of bits available and whether one bit is used to holdthe sign
0,since all numbers are stored as binary digits an unsignedinteger has a range from 0 to 2bits where bits is the totalnumber of bits available
0,thus if there are 16 bits available the maximum value for an integer is 65535
0,if negativenumbers are to be handled a signed integer must be used in most languages such as c c and java an integer issigned unless unsigned is specified
0,since one bit is usedto hold the sign and each bit doubles the maximum size itfollows that a signed integer can have only half the rangeabove or below zero
0,thus a 16 bit signed integer can rangefrom 32 768 to 32 767
0,one complication is that the available sizes of integersdepend on whether the computer system s native data sizeis 16 32 or 64 bits
0,in most cases the native size is 32 bits so the declaration int in a c program on such a machineimplies a signed 32 bit integer that can range from 231 or 2 147 483 647 to 231 1 or 2 147 483 647
0,however if one isusing large numbers in a program it is important to checkthat the chosen type is large enough
0,the long specifier isoften used to indicate an integer twice the normal size or64 bits in this case
0,numbers with a fractional decimal part are usually storedin a format called floating point
0,the floating means thatthe location of the decimal point can be moved as necessaryto fit the number within the specified digit range
0,a floatingpoint number is actually stored in four separate parts
0,firstcomes the sign indicating whether the number is negativeor positive
0,next comes the mantissa which contains theactual digits of the number both before and after the decimal point
0,the radix is the base for the number systemused
0,finally the exponent determines where the decimalpoint will be placed
0,for example the base 10 number 247
0,35 could be represented as 24735 10 2
0,the 2 moves the decimal pointat the end two places to the left
0,however floating pointnumbers are normalized to a form in which there is just onedigit to the left of the decimal point
0,thus 247
0,35 wouldactually be written 2
0,4735 102
0,this system is also knownas scientific notation
0,as noted earlier actual data storage in modern computers is always in binary but the same principle applies
0,according to ieee standard 754 32 bit floating point numbers use 1 bit for the sign 8 bits for the exponent and 23bits for the mantissa also called the significand since itexpressed the digits that are significant that is guaranteed not to be lost through overflow or underflow in processing
0,the double precision float declared as a double in c programs uses 1 11 and 52 bits respectively
0,many objects are more elaborate or specialized variations ofmore basic objects
0,for example in microsoft windows thevarious kinds of dialog boxes are specialized versions of thegeneral window class
0,therefore the specialized versionis created by declaring it to be derived from a base class
0,put another way the specialized class inherits the basicdata and functions available in the base parent class
0,theprogrammer can then add new data or functions or modifythe inherited ones to create the necessary behavior for thespecialized class
0,languages such as c allow for a class to be derivedfrom more than one base class
0,this is called multipleinheritance
0,for example a message window class mightinherit its overall structure from the window class andits text display capabilities from the message class
0,however it can sometimes be difficult to keep the relationshipsbetween multiple classes clear
0,the java language takes thealternative approach of being limited to only single inheritance of classes but allowing interfaces specifications ofhow a class interacts with the program to be multiplyinherited
0,different kinds of objects often have analogous methods
0,for example suppose there is a series of classes that represent various polygons square triangle hexagon and so forth
0,each class has a method called perimeter thatreturns the total distance around the edges of the object
0,ifeach of these classes is derived from a base polygon class each class inherits the base class s perimeter method andadapts it for its own use
0,thus a square might calculateits perimeter simply by multiplying the length of a side byfour while the rectangle would have to add up differentsized pairs of sides and so on
0,in the late 1990s banner ads started to appear on websites and other forms of advertising soon followed
0,companies rushed into the online world either with the belief thatit had unlimited potential for finding new customers or outof fear that the competition would get there first
0,unfortunately it was hard to measure the actual effectiveness ofads and web sites such as for publications that lookedto third party advertising as a source of income found theoutlook bleak in the wake of the bursting of the dot combubble of the early 2000 decade
0,only a few years later however advertisers using newbusiness models and targeting techniques have made onlineadvertising not only a viable business but a rapidly growing one
0,according to the interactive advertsing bureau internet advertising revenue in the united states in 2007was 21
0,2 billion up 26 percent from 2005
0,the effects of the online advertising revolution are rippling outward impacting traditional advertising mediasuch as newspapers in particular see craigslist magazines and even television
0,types of ads include the following banner ads are contained in rectangles often at the topof the web page
0,sometimes they can mimic dialogboxes from the operating system
0,they still accountfor about half of all online advertising and can appearon sites of all types
0,pop up or pop under ads appear above or beneath thecurrent window respectivelyfloating ads appear over the main page content oftenmoving across the screen
0,interstitial ads are displayed before the requestedcontent such as an article or video is shown
0,theyrun for a specified period of time although they cansometimes be closed by the viewer
0,many ads are animated some even contain video clips
0,there are also ads formatted for mobile devices includingtext messages sent to cell phones
0,google and other large search enginesor portals can make money from advertisers is through affiliate marketing google s version is called ad sense
0,participating web sites are indexed and the resulting keywords are matched with ads awaiting placement
0,the sitecarrying the ad generally gets a per click payment
0,however the problem of click fraud has also arisen scammerscan set up an affiliate site and then use special software togenerate the clicks while making them come from a varietyof sources
0,despite these problems in 2006 about 40 percent of revenue from online advertising was attributed tosearch related ads
0,the dark side of online advertising is found in programsthat are surreptitiously installed on users pcs and thendownload and display advertising from shady web operations
0,while many users nowregularly run programs to block such malware even legitimate online advertising can irritate users particularlywhen ads are too prominent float over and block text orlurk behind the browser window
0,modern web browsershave ad blocking features that work with varying degreesof effectiveness
0,as with tv online advertisers increasinglyhave to cope with impatient users who do not have to lookat ads unless they actually want to
0,advertisers can employ several strategies to keep userswilling to look at ads
0,one is to make the ad unobtrusiveand brief and on the way to something the user reallywants to see
0,in 2007 youtube began such advertising
0,another is to provide free versions of software or servicesthat in exchange for being free require the user to put upwith some screen real estate being devoted to ads
0,finally as with tv advertising can be woven into the content itself such as in online computer games
0,a sensitive area is the attempt to balance advertisers desire to know as much as possible about consumers interestsand buying habits with the same consumers concern aboutprotecting their privacy
0,a variety of other frauds and scams appear online or viae mail with some frequency the 419 or nigerian money letter that promises arich cut for helping facilitate a money transfer for adistressed official fraudulent charitable solicitations particularly aftersuch disasters as the asian tsunami or hurricanekatrina adoption and marriage scams educational fraud such as worthless degrees offeredby unaccredited institutions dubious employment schemes or home businesses involving preparing mailings or medical billing services that offer to repair bad credit ratings tax avoidance schemes often based on nonexistentlegal claims or loopholes
0,online casinos appeared in 1995 but at first they couldonly be played for fun with no actual money changinghands
0,that soon changed in 1996 intercasino appeared it would be the first of hundreds of online casinos sportsbookmakers and other types of gambling
0,generally theseoperations are based outside of the united states caribbean islands such as antigua and cura ao are popular locations
0,online casinos offer traditional table games such asblackjack roulette and craps
0,generally odds and payoffsare comparable to those at traditional casinos
0,assumingthe game is honest and properly programmed the house srevenue comes from a percentage of the amount bet blackjack having the lowest house percentage and roulette thegreatest
0,slot machines which give an even higher percentage to the house can also be simulated online
0,online poker has become very popular particularly gamessuch as texas hold em
0,estimated revenues from onlinepoker in the united states were 2
0,4 billion in 2005
0,unlike the case with casino games online poker playersplay against each other not the house
0,the house s revenuecomes from a rake or percentage of the pot
0,many sitesoffer organized tournaments and some online players havegone on to win traditional tournaments
0,the aptly namedchris moneymaker won an online tournament qualifyinghim to enter the 2004 world series of poker which he wenton to win
0,like online casinos online poker is illegal in the unitedstates
0,proponents argue that while any given hand is random poker in the long run is a game of skill not chance
0,agroup called the poker players alliance has been lobbyingto exempt poker from internet gambling laws
0,a third type of online gambling is sports betting whichis legal in many countries but only in nevada in the unitedstates
0,the web has also given sports bettors a forum fordiscussing or arguing about teams and their prospects
0,online games today range from elaborate war games toopen ended fantasy worlds to virtual universes that mirror real world activities including economics politics andeven education
0,the first online games appeared in the late 1970s onplato an educational network as well as on the earlyinternet of the 1980s
0,these muds multiuser dungeons were generally based on pen and paper role playing gamesof the time notably dungeons dragons
0,these games were text based with players typing their characters actionsand dialog while the changing world as seen by the players was similarly described
0,by the early 1990s however muds had spun off many variants
0,many were still hackn slash dungeon games which were also offered on america online and other commercial services
0,many of thesemud like games such as aol s neverwinter nights offeredsimple graphics
0,meanwhile other games began to offermore sophisticated social interactions as well as the abilityof players to make their own additions to the game world including buildings
0,today s online games feature a persistent world hosted onone or more servers that grows and develops from day to dayand in which the avatars or representatives of thousandsof players interact with game generated creatures or oneanother using client software
0,players can spend hundredsof hours helping their characters develop skills increasingtheir levels through experience points gained from successful combat or other activities
0,players and their characters frequently form organizations such as guilds or clans because the tougher challenges generally require the cooperation of different types of classes of characters fighters healers and magic users
0,modern mm orpgs began in the late 1990s with suchtitles as ultima online and everquest
0,the most popularmmorpg in the mid 2000s was world of warcraft
0,as with shoppers investors have increasingly been attractedto the interactivity and ease of online transactions
0,in addition to allowing stocks to be bought or sold with just a fewclicks online brokers also called discount brokers chargemuch lower transaction fees than their traditional counterparts typically less than 10 per trade
0,some online brokers such as e trade scottrade andtd ameritrade were established as internet brokers
0,however traditional brokerages such as charles schwab andwaterhouse have also opened online discount brokerages
0,in addition to fast inexpensive trading many onlinebrokers also offer a variety of resources and tools including stock quotes and charts research reports and screening programs to help investors pick the mutual funds orindividual investments that meet their objectives
0,for moresophisticated investors some brokers offer simulations fortesting investment strategies and programmed trading which will execute buy or sell orders automatically depending on specified conditions
0,online brokers can specialize seeking customers whowant to make frequent trades but do not need other support or investors who are interested in obtaining ipos initial public offerings of up and coming companies
0,somebrokers may emphasize mutual funds and cater to retirement accounts while others might offer government or corporate bonds foreign stocks penny stocks or more exoticinvestments
0,the interactivity and low transaction costs in onlineinvesting may encourage people to become involved inhighly speculative penny stocks options day trading foreign exchange markets and other areas that are not suitablefor most individual investors
0,while there is a great dealof useful information available online it is a good idea tobegin by discussing investment goals and potential riskswith a trusted financial adviser
0,in evaluating a job site it is important to get a feel forthe kinds of jobs offered and the target audience such asprofessionals recent graduates white collar or service sector jobs and so on
0,other important features to look forinclude powerful search or filtering capability such as by typeof job or employer keywords in job description orlocality the ability to put one s resume online and edit orupdate it as needed
0,the ability to have several versions of one s resumetailored to different types of jobs automatic e mail alerts about newly added jobs thatmeet the user s criteria privacy protections so that contact information fromresumes is not used for marketing or other nonemployment purposes lack of fees to job seekers normally employers are theservice s source of revenue
0,a persistent problem in artificial intelligence is how to provide a software systemwith a model that it can use to reason about a particularsubject or domain
0,a data model or ontology basically consists of classes to which the relevant objects might belong relationships between classes and attributes that objects inthat class can possess
0,for implementation of these ideaswithin programming languages see classes and objectoriented programming
0,for example a business ontology might include classessuch as entity a business or person supplier an entity that provides wholesale goods orservices customer an entity that buys the company s goodsor services contractor an entity that performs work for thecompany on contract
0,ontologies can be used to provide guidance to a variety oftypes of programs for example see expert system natural language processing and software agent
0,thusif an automatic news summarizer program encounters astory that includes references to opposing lawyers and legalissues it could apply an ontology that defines the likelyrelationship of the participants in the case
0,creating useful ontologies is quite labor intensive interms of the human thinking and coding involved
0,however there have been substantial efforts in recent years tocreate anthologies for many fields particularly in biologyand genetics
0,the web ontology language owl is apopular tool for creating ontologies that can be used tomake web content more understandable to programs
0,meanwhile an ambitious and long running projectcalled cyc for encyclopedia under the direction of douglas lenat has been engaged in creating what amounts tovast ontologies for many of the domains included in everyday human life as well as specialized fields of knowledge
0,alarge portion of this work has been made available as opensource
0,according to stallman and many other advocates opensource software is not necessarily free
0,what is requiredis that users receive the full source code or have it readilyavailable for free or at nominal charge
0,users are free tomodify or expand the source code to create and distributenew versions of the software
0,following a legal mechanismthat stallman calls copyleft the distributor of opensource software must allow subsequent recipients the samefreedom to revise and redistribute
0,however not all software that is billed as open source follows all of stallman srequirements including being copylefted
0,formally opensource software is generally licensed according to variousversions of the general public license gpl
0,the latestversion gpl3 released in 2007 has been controversial
0,among other things it more aggressively attempts to prevent open source software from being restricted or otherwise hampered by being combined with patented softwareor proprietary hardware
0,an operating system is an overarching program that manages the resources of the computer
0,it runs programs andprovides them with access to memory ram input outputdevices a file system and other services
0,it provides application programmers with a way to invoke system services andgives users a way to control programs and organize files
0,the core functions include booting the system and initializing devices process management loading programs intro memory assigning them a share ofprocessing time and allowing processes to communicatewith the operating system or one another
0,multiprogramming systems often implement not only processes running programs but also threads or sections ofcode within programs that can be controlled separately
0,a memory management scheme is used to organize andaddress memory handle requests to allocate memory freeup memory no longer being used and rearrange memory tomaximize the useful amount
0,there is also a scheme for organizing data created orused by programs into files of various types
0,mostoperating systems today have a hierarchical file system thatallows for files to be organized into directories or foldersthat can be further subdivided if necessary
0,designers of modern operating systems face a numberof continuing challenges security in a world where nearly all computers arenetworked often continuously the tradeoff between powerful attractive functionssuch as scripting and the security vulnerabilities theytend to present the need to provide support for new applications suchas streaming audio and video ease of use in installing new devices the continuing development of new user interfaceconcepts including alternative interfaces for the disabled and for special applications the growing use of multiprocessing and multiprogramming requiring coordination of processors sharingmemory and communicating with one another distributed systems where server programs clientprograms and data objects can be allocated amongmany networked computers and allocations continually adjusted or balanced to reflect demand on thesystem the spread of portable mobile and handheld computers and computers embedded in devices such asengine control systems
0,sometimes the choice isbetween devising a scaled down version of an existing operating system and designing a new os that isoptimized for devices that may have limited memoryand storage capacity
0,generally speaking the levels of precedence for mostlanguages are as follows 1 scope resolution operators specify local v globalversions of a variable 2 invoking a method from a class array subscript function call increment or decrement3
0,size of gets number of bytes in an object addressand pointer dereference other unary operators such as not and complement creation and deallocation functions type casts 4 class member selection through a pointer5
0,multiplication division and modulus6
0,addition and subtraction7
0,left and right shift operators8
0,less than and greater than9
0,equal and not equal operators10
0,bitwise operators and then exclusive or inclusive or 11 logical operators and then or 12 assignment statements
0,today it is easy to optically scan text or graphics printed onpages and convert it into a graphical representation for storage in the computer
0,however a shape suchas a letter c doesn t mean anything in particular as a graphic
0,optical character recognition ocr is the process of identifying the letter or other document element that correspondsto a given part of the scanned image and converting it tothe appropriate character
0,ifthe process is successful the result is a text document thatcan be manipulated in a word processor database or otherprogram that handles text
0,raymond kurzweil 1948 marketed the first commercially practicable general purposeoptical character recognition system in 1978
0,once the document page has been scanned into an imageformat there are various ways to identify the characters
0,one method is to use stored templates that indicate the pattern of pixels that should correspond to each character
0,generally a threshold of similarity is defined so that an exactmatch is not necessary to classify a character the templatemost similar to the character is chosen
0,some systems storea set of templates for each of the fonts most commonly foundin printed text
0,recognizing cursive writing is a much morecomplex process see handwriting recognition
0,a more generalized method uses structural features such as all t s have a single vertical line and a shortercrossbar line to classify characters
0,to analyze a character the different types of individual features are identified andthen compared to a set of rules to determine the charactercorresponding to that particular combination of features
0,sometimes thresholds or fuzzy logic are used to decidethe probable identity of a character
0,jaguar panther tiger and leopard these and other namesof sleek big cats represent versions of apple s macintoshoperating system os x pronounced os 10 see applecorporation and macintosh
0,unlike the previous macos os x while broadly maintaining apple s user interfacestyle is based on a version of unixcalled openstep developed by next starting in the 1980s
0,os x development began when steve jobsreturned as apple ceo in 1997 and the company bought next acquiring the software
0,thefirst version os x 10
0,0 or cheetah was released in 2001 but the system was not widely used until 10
0,1 puma wasreleased later the same year
0,at the core of os x is a free and open source version ofunix called darwin with a kernel called xnu
0,on top ofthis apple built a distinctive and subtly colorful user interface called aqua and a new version of the macintosh finderfile and program management system
0,today os x includes a variety of useful software packages some free and some optional
0,these include ilife digitalmedia management iwork productivity and front row home media center
0,os x10
0,5 also includes time machine an automatic backup system that can restore files includingdeleted files as well as earlier system settings
0,for software developers os x provides an integrateddevelopment environment called xcode which workswith modified open source compilers for major programming languages including c c and java
0,further because os x is unix based many unix and linux programs can be recompiled to run on it
0,since mid 2005 apple and os x have been transitioning from the earlier ibm motorola processors to intel processors
0,this transition waslargely complete by 2007 though os x 10
0,5 leopard stillprovides support for applications written for the powerpc
0,os x has been well received by critics and together withits bundled software has made the macintosh a popularplatform for users who want a seamless computing experience particularly with regard to graphics and media
0,with a parallel connection however the eight bitsof the byte are sent simultaneously each along its own wire so parallel ports are generally faster than serial ports
0,also since the data is transmitted simultaneously the protocolfor marking the beginning and end of each data byte is simpler
0,on the other hand parallel cables are more expensive since they contain more wires and are generally limitedto a length of 10 feet or so because of electrical interferencebetween the parallel wires
0,the original parallel interface for personal computerswas designed by centronics and a later version of this 36 pin connector remains popular today
0,later ibm designed a25 pin version
0,in addition to the wires carrying data additional wires are used to carry control signals
0,after many years of effort researchers have been able tocreate systems that can recognize particular human faces
0,on the other hand any normalsix month old child can effortlessly recognize familiarfaces such as parents
0,the fundamental task of turningraw data whether from senses instruments or computerfiles into recognizable objects or drawing inferences iscalled pattern recognition
0,pattern recognition is at theheart of many areas of research and application in computing
0,despite the challenge in getting machines to do what comes naturally for biological organisms the potentialpayoffs are immense
0,a pattern recognition system begins with data whetherstored or real time such as from a robot s camera
0,the firsttask in turning potentially billions of bytes of data intomeaningful objects is to extract features from what is likelya high proportion of redundant or irrelevant data
0,withvisual images this often involves finding edges that defineshapes
0,the extracted features are then classified to determine what objects they might represent
0,this can be doneby comparing structures to templates or previously classified data or by applying statistical analysis to determine thelikely correlation of the new data to existing patterns
0,pattern recognition often includes learning algorithmsas well indeed the field is often considered to be a subtopicof machine learning
0,for example classification systemscan be refined by training them and reinforcing successful determinations
0,the first stage in making computing available away fromthe office desk was the development of portable and thenlaptop computers in the 1980s
0,laptops however are relatively heavy and bulky and thusnot suitable for activities such as making notes at meetings or keeping track of appointments while on the go
0,the logical solution to that need was to develop a computer small enough to carry in a pocket or purse
0,the firsthandheld computer to achieve widespread recognition wasapple s newton which the company referred to as a personal digital assistant
0,this term usually abbreviated topda became a generic category with the introduction ofthe palm pilot which first appeared in 1996 followed bythe seemingly ubiquitous rim blackberry in 1999
0,the pdf specifications are open source so anyone canwrite software to create or read documents in the format
0,pdf includes three elements a subset of the postscript pagedescription language a system for specifying and embedding common fonts or referring to otherfonts and a system for packaging the text and graphicsdescriptions into a file in compressed form
0,later versionsof the pdf specification also allow users to interact withthe document such as by filling in fields in a form or adding annotations to the text
0,pdf also includes support fortags and descriptors that can be used with programs such as screen readers for the blind
0,pdf also includes support for encrypting documents sothey can only be read with a password and for controllingwhether the document can be copied or printed though thisdepends on the user s software understanding and obeyingthe restrictions
0,although creating and editing pdf documents originally required the relatively expensive adobe acrobat software there are now a number of free or low cost editorsand other pdf utilities for windows mac os x and linux unix platforms
0,the explosive growth of the world wide web has confronted programmers with the need to find ways to link databases and other existing resources to web sites
0,the specifications for such linkages are found in the common gateway interface
0,however the early facilities for writing cgi scripts were awkward and often frustrating to use
0,back in 1986 unix developer larry wall had created a language called perl practical extraction and report language
0,there were already ways to write scripts for simple data processing as well as a handy pattern manipulation language
0,however wall wanted to provide a greater variety of functions and techniques for finding extracting and formatting data
0,perl attracted a following within the unix community
0,since much web development was being done on unix based systems by the mid and late 1990s it was natural that many webmasters and applications programmers would turn to perl to write their cgi scripts
0,as with many unix scripting languages perl s syntax is broadly similar to c however the philosophy behind c is to provide a sparse core language with most functionality being handled by standard or add in program libraries
0,perl on the other hand starts with most of the functionality of unix utilities such as sed stream editor c shell and awk including the powerful regular expressions familiar to unix users
0,the language also includes a hash data type a collection of paired keys and values that makes it easy for a program to maintain and check lists such as of internet hosts and their ip addresses
0,in today s health care environment patients often have only a few minutes to ask their doctor important questions about their condition and possible treatments
0,patients often feel they have been left on their own when it comes to obtaining detailed information
0,according to surveys by the pew internet american life project by the end of 2005 about 20 percent of web users were reporting that the internet has greatly improved the way they get information about health care
0,further 7 million users had reported that web sites had played a crucial or important role in coping with a major illness
0,a variety of web sites ranging from comprehensive and excellent to dubious at best offer health related information
0,in evaluating them it is important to determine who sponsors the site and what is the source of the information provided
0,the very extensive webmd site for example is reviewed for accuracy by an independent panel of experts
0,one of the foremost medical institutions the mayo clinic also has an authoritative site
0,the site organizedwisdom
0,com offers a search engine that emphasizes information that has been reviewed by doctors for accuracy while eliminating low quality or duplicative results
0,even if information is accurate however users may often lack the necessary background or context for interpreting it correctly
0,understanding the results of medical studies for example requires some knowledge of how studies are designed the population used and the statistical significance and applicability of the results
0,as a practical matter therefore patients should not make any major decisions about diet medication or treatment options without consulting a medical professional
0,attempts at self diagnosis can be particularly prob
0,when modern digital computing emerged in the 1940s it evolved from two roots engineering particularly electrical engineering and mathematics
0,the goals of the earliest computer designers were focused naturally enough on computing although several early thinkers had already begun to think of computers as symbol processing and knowledgeretrieving machines not just number crunchers
0,as computer scientists began to become more concerned about the structure of data and the modeling of real world objects in computer languages they began to wrestle with some areas long familiar to philosophers
0,as data structure involved into knowledge representations epistemology the philosophical investigation of the meaning and accessibility of knowledge became more relevant particularly in developing systems for artificial intelligence and machine learning
0,also relevant is ontology the nature and relationship of entities see ontologies and data models particularly with regard to the modern effort to encode relationships between items of knowledge into web pages
0,just about anyone with an e mail account has received messages purporting to be from a bank a popular e commerce site such as amazon or ebay or even a government agency
0,typically the message warns of a problem such as a suspended account and urges the recipient to click on a link in the message
0,if the user does so what appears to look like the actual site of the relevant institution is actually a spoof or fake site
0,if the user goes on to enter information such as account numbers or passwords in order to fix the problem the information actually goes to the operator of the fake site where it can be used for fraudulent purchases or even impersonation
0,the bogus site can also attempt to download viruses spyware keyloggers or other forms of malware to the unwitting user s computerthis all too common scenario is called phishing alluding to fishing for unwary users with various sorts of bait with the f changed to ph in keeping with traditional hacker practice
0,phishing is similar to other techniques for manipulating people through deception fear or greed that hackers often refer to as social engineering
0,unlike oneon one approaches however phishing relies on the ability to send large quantities of e mail at virtually no cost the availability of simple techniques for disguising both e mail addresses and web addresses urls and the ease with which the appearance of a web site can be convincingly replicated
0,although e mail is the most common hook for phishing any form of communication including text or instant messages can be used
0,recently sites such as myspace have become targets for automated phishing expeditions that changed links on pages to point to fraudulent sites
0,wary users have a number of ways to reduce their chance of being phished
0,some signs of bogus messages include the message is addressed generically dear paypal user or to the user s e mail address rather than the account name
0,the text of the message contains spelling errors or poor grammar
0,the url shown for a link in the message perhaps via a tool tip does not match the institution s real web address
0,fortunately there are ways in which software can help detect and block most phishing attempts
0,a good spam filter is the first line of defense and can block many phishing messages from getting to the user in the first place
0,anti phishing features are also increasingly included in web browsers or available as plug ins
0,thus blacklists of known phishing sites can be checked in real time and warnings given or the site s address can be blocked from access by the system
0,web sites can also introduce an added layer of security bank of america for example asks users to select and label one of several images offered by the bank
0,the image and label are subsequent displayed as part of the log in process
0,if the user does not see the image and the user s label then the site is presumably not the real bank site
0,the php processor parses only the code within the delimiters
0,and
0,an alternative set of delimiters is script language php script
0,besides being embedded in html pages php can be used interactively at the command line where it has replaced older languages such as awk perl or shell scripting for many users
0,php can also be linked to user interface libraries such as gtk for linux unix to create applications that run on the client machine rather than the server
0,php has a basic set of data types plus one called resource that represents data processed by special functions that return images text files database records and so on
0,additionally php5 provides full support for objects including private and protected member variables constructors and destructors and other features similar to those found in c and other languages
0,there are numerous libraries of open source objects and functions that enable php scripts to perform common internet tasks including accessing database servers such as mysql as well as extensions to the language to handle popular web formats such as adobe flash animation
0,programmers have access to a wide range of php resources through pear the php extension and application repository
0,the combination of sophisticated features and easy interactive scripting has made php the language of choice for many web developers who use it as part of the group of technologies called lamp for linux apache web server mysql database and php
0,because of its many practical features and its availability for the popular ibm 360 mainframes pl i enjoyed considerable success in the late 1960s and 1970s
0,the language was later ported to most major platforms and operating systems
0,when personal computers came along pl i became available for ibm s os 2 operating system as well as for microsoft s dos and windows although the language never really caught on in those environments
0,computer scientists such as structured programming guru edsger dijkstra decried pl i s lack of a clear welldefined structure
0,in his turing award lecture in 1972 dijkstra opined that i absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming language our basic tool mind you already escapes our intellectual control
0,see dijkstra edsger
0,on a practical level the sheer number of features in the language meant that truly mastering it was a lengthy process
0,a language like c on the other hand had a much simpler core to master even though it was less versatile
0,pl i also tended to retain the mainframe associations from its birth at ibm while c grew up in the world of minicomputers and the unix community and proved more suitable for pcs
0,nevertheless pl i provided many examples that language designers could use in attempting to design better implementations
0,by the mid 1990s intel was promoting a standard for the automated detection and configuration of devices
0,known as plug and play pnp this standard was incorporated in versions of microsoft windows starting with windows 95
0,the required hardware support soon appeared on pc motherboards and expansion cards
0,with plug and play the user simply connects a printer scanner or other device to the pc
0,windows detects that a device has been connected and queries it for its official name and other information
0,if necessary windows can then prompt the user for a disk containing the appropriate driver or even search for a driver on a web site
0,the concept of plug and play extends beyond the windows world however
0,in recent years there has been interest in developing a universal plug and play upnp protocol by which a variety of devices could automatically configure themselves with any of a variety of different networks
0,this would be particularly helpful for home users who are increasingly setting up small networks so they can share broadband internet connections as well as the growing number of users who want their desktop pc to work with handheld palm computers and other devices
0,microsoft supports upnp in versions of windows starting with me and xp
0,a number of applications programs include the ability for third party developers to write small programs that extend the main program s functionality
0,for example thousands of filters algorithms for transforming images have been written for adobe photoshop
0,these small programs are called plug ins because they are designed to connect to the main program and provide their service whenever it is desired or required
0,perhaps the most commonly encountered plug ins are those available for web browsers such as firefox netscape or internet explorer
0,plug ins can enable the browser to display new types of files such as multimedia
0,many standard programs for particular kinds of files are now provided both as stand alone applications and as browser plug ins
0,examples include adobe pdf document format apple quicktime graphics video and animation realplayer streaming video and audio and macromedia flash interactive animation and presentation
0,these and many other plug ins are offered free for the downloading in order to increase the number of potential users for the formats and thus the market for the development packages
0,one of the most useful plug ins found in most browsers is one that allows the browser to run java applets
0,in turn java is often used to write other plug ins
0,beyond such traditional workhorses a number of innovative browser plug ins have appeared particularly for the increasingly popular firefox browser
0,for example there are plug ins that enable the user to view and work with the html and other elements of the page being viewed
0,another popular area is plug ins that make it easier to capture and organize material from web pages going well beyond the standard favorites or bookmark facility
0,podcasting from ipod plus broadcasting lets users subscribe to and automatically download regularly distributed content such as radio broadcasts over the internet
0,the media files can be stored on an apple ipod or other media player personal computer or other device
0,podcasting became popular starting around 2004 05 and has become widely used by individuals and organizations
0,typically files to be podcast are put on a web server
0,the urls for the files and other information such as episode titles is provided in files called feeds using a format such as rss or atom
0,the user installs client software such as ipodder browses the feeds such as through an online directory and decides what to subscribe to
0,the software then periodically checks the feeds obtains the urls of the latest files and downloads them automatically
0,the software can if desired then transfer the downloaded files to a portable media player such as over a usb connection
0,there are many sources of podcasts
0,news organizations can provide regular audio or video podcasts as a supplement to regular text material
0,podcasting also offers a way for a small news organization or independent journalist to build an audience using equipment as simple as a microphone and perhaps a video camera
0,podcasts also provide a way for political organizations to keep in touch with supporters and perhaps supply them with talking points
0,any source of periodically distributed audio or video can be a candidate for podcasting
0,these include class lectures corporate communications and even religious services
0,early computer printers were limited to one or a few built in fonts either stamped on typewriter style keys on daisy wheels or stored as patterns in the printer s software with dot matrix printers
0,in the mid 1970s when xerox researchers were developing the laser printer they realized they needed an actual programming language that could describe fonts graphics and other elements that could be printed on the more versatile new printers
0,parc researchers developed interpress meanwhile two of them john warnock and chuck geschke founded their own company in 1982
0,they then created a more streamlined version of interpress that they called postscript
0,the first printer to include built in postscript capability was apple s laserwriter in 1985
0,postscript soon became the standard for a burgeoning industry
0,because postscript is an actual programming language for a somewhat similar language see forth software such as word processors can include functions that turn a text document into a postscript document ready for printing
0,a postscript interpreter in the printer or even in another application interprets the postscript commands to re create the document
0,the commands specify rasters combinations of straight lines and curves which can be scaled and transformed to provide the specified output including fonts which can be enhanced by including hints to help the system identify key features
0,this processor is thus sometimes called a raster image processor rip
0,whether at a business meeting or a scientific conference the use of slides or transparencies has been largely replaced by software that can create a graphic presentation
0,generally the user creates a series of virtual slides which can consist of text such as bullet points and charts or other graphics
0,often there are templates already structured for various types of presentations so the user only needs to supply the appropriate text or graphics
0,there are a variety of options for the general visual style as well as for transitions such as dissolves between slides
0,another useful feature is the ability to time the presentation and provide cues for the speaker
0,finished presentations can be shown on a standard monitor screen if the audience is small or output to a screen projectormicrosoft powerpoint is the most widely used presentation program
0,it includes the ability to import excel spreadsheets word documents or other items created by microsoft office suite applications
0,the user can switch between outline view which shows the overall structure of the presentation to viewing individual slides or working with the slides as a collection
0,there are a number of alternatives available including apple s keynote and open office which includes a presentation program comparable to powerpoint
0,another alternative is to use html web authoring programs to create the presentation in the form of a set of linked web pages
0,powerpoint and other presentation packages can also convert their presentations to html
0,although creating presentations in html may be more difficult than using a proprietary package and the results may be somewhat less polished the universality of html and the ability to run presentations from a web site are strong advantages of that approach
0,the large computers that first became available in the 1950s used line printers
0,these devices have one hammer for each column of the output
0,a rapidly moving band of type moves under the hammers
0,each hammer strikes the band when the correct character passes by
0,printing is therefore done line by line hence the name
0,line printers were fast 600 lines per minute or more but like the mainframes they served they were bulky and expensive
0,the typewriter offered another point of departure for designing printers
0,a few early computers such as the binac an offshoot of eniac used typewriters rigged with magnetically controlled switches solenoids
0,however a more natural fit was with the teletype invented early in the 20th century to print telegraph messages
0,since the teletype is already designed to print from electrically transmitted character codes it was easy to rig up a circuit to translate the contents of computer data into appropriate codes for printing
0,since the teletype could send as well as receive messages it was often used as a control terminal for computer operators or for time sharing computer users into the 1970s
0,the daisy wheel printer was another typewriter like device
0,it used a movable wheel with the letters embedded in slim petals hence the name
0,it was slow about 10 characters a second noisy and expensive but it was the only affordable alternative for early personal computer users who required letter quality output
0,the dot matrix printer which came into common use in the 1980s uses a different principle of operation than typewriter style printers
0,unlike the latter the dot matrix printer does not form solid characters
0,instead it uses an array of magnetically controlled pins 9 pins at first but 24 on later models
0,each character is formed by pressing the appropriate pins into a ribbon that pushes into the paper leaving a pattern of tiny dots
0,besides being relatively inexpensive dot matrix printers are versatile in that a great variety of character styles or fonts can be printed either by loading different sets of bitmaps
0,likewise graphic images can also be printed
0,however because the characters are made of tiny dots they don t have the crisp solid look of printed type
0,good project management software provides many tools for the purpose
0,available charts and reports often include
0,gantt charts that use bars to show the duration and percentage of completion of the various overlapping subprojects or tasks
0,pert program evaluation and review technique charts that show each subproject or task as a rectangular node with information about the task
0,the connections between nodes show the relationships dependencies between the items
0,pert charts are usually used at the beginning stages of planning
0,analysis tools that show critical paths and bottlenecks places where one or more tasks falling behind might threaten large portions of the project
0,generally the more preceding items a task is dependent on the more likely that task is to fall behind
0,tools for estimating the probability for completion of a given task based on the probabilities of tasks it is dependent on as well as other factors such as the likelihood of certain resources becoming available
0,a system of alerts or stoplights that show slowdowns potential problems or areas where work has stopped completely
0,these can be set to be triggered when various specified conditions occur
0,integration between project management and budget reporting so tasks and the project as a whole can be monitored in relation to budget constraints
0,integration between the project management software and individual schedules kept in pim software such as microsoft outlook or in handheld computers pdas such as the palmpilot
0,integration between project management and software for scheduling meetin
0,computing is a complex pervasive and increasingly vital human activity
0,it is not surprising that human psychology can play an important role in many aspects of computer use
0,since the 1960s psychology in particular see cognitivescience has contributed to the structuring of interaction between computer systems and users
0,it is important to note the significant differences between how computers and humans perceive and process information computers are extremely fast in processing in a highly structured setting e g a program
0,the human brain on the other hand while thousands of times slower is thus far greatly superior in coping with loosely structured data through pattern recognition the making of analogies and generalization
0,a number of researchers have promoted the idea of creating a human computer synergy where the structure of the system takes advantage of both the machine s computational and data retrieval abilities and the human user s ability to work with the larger picture
0,such research is continuing as autonomous software and is beginning to interact with web user
0,the internet and its perception as a shared cyberspace adds new dimensions to the psychology of computing
0,in fact the emphasis here is not on computation per se but on the representation of ideas and images communication social interaction and identity
0,in particular pioneering work has illuminated ways in which online interactions affect identity and sense of self even encouraging the assumption of multiple identities
0,indeed virtual worlds such as second life offer new ways to study the formation of communities and social interactions
0,on the positive side it has been argued that cyberspace has encouraged people particularly adolescents to experiment with new identities in a relatively safe environment but lack of inhibition and experience can lead to risky behavior such as involvement with sexual predators
0,the very fact that many people particularly the young may spend several hours a day or more immersed in the online world has also led to concerns some psychologists have even suggested that internet addiction disorder iad be included as an official mental disorder similar to compulsive gambling
0,however as of 2007 the american medical association has not recommended that iad be classified as a mental disorder and the american society of addiction medicine has resisted such a status
0,generally excessive or inappropriate use of the internet has been seen as a symptom of more traditional diagnoses such as obsession or compulsion
0,python is particularly useful for system administrators webmasters and other people who have to link various files data source or programs to perform their daily tasks
0,the language currently has a small but growing and quite enthusiastic following
0,without the semicolons and braces found in c and related languages python looks rather like basic
0,also note that the type of input data doesn t have to be declared
0,the runtime mechanism will assume it s numeric from the expression found in the print statement
0,python programs thus tend to be shorter and simpler than c java or even perl programs
0,the simple syntax and lack of data typing does not mean that python is not a serious language however
0,python contains full facilities for object oriented programming for example
0,python programs can be written quickly and easily by trying commands out interactively and then converted the script to bytecode a machine independent representation that can be run on an interpreter designed for each machine environment
0,alternatively there are translation programs that can convert a python script to a c source file that can then be compiled for top speed
0,by combining mirroring error correction and or striping different levels of raid can be implemented to suit different needs
0,there are various trade offs striping can increase access speed but uses more storage space and by increasing the number of disks also increases the chance that one will fail
0,implementing error correction can make failure recoverable but slows data access down because data has to be read from more than one location and compared
0,the most commonly used raid levels are raid 0 striping data across disks higher speed but no error correction failure of any disk can make data unrecoverable raid 1 mirroring data stored on at least two disks data intact as long as one disk is still operating raid 3 and 4 striping plus a dedicated disk for parity error checking raid 5 striping with distributed parity data can be restored automatically after a failed disk is replaced raid 6 like raid 5 but with parity distributed so that data remains intact unless more than two drives failin actuality raid configurations can be very complex where different levels can be layered above one another with each treating the next as a virtual drive until one gets down to the actual hardware
0,although raid is often implemented using a physical hardware controller operating systems can also create a virtual raid structure in software interposed between the logical drive as seen by the read write routines and the physical drives
0,back in the days of mechanical clocks curious kids would sometimes take a clock apart to try to figure out how it worked
0,a few were even able to reassemble the clock correctly these youngsters were likely to become engineers
0,with software reverse engineering is the process of taking apart software and analyzing its operation without having access to the program code itself
0,among other possibilities reverse engineering may allow one to provide equivalent functions without violating copyright laws emulate one operating system within another determine a file format so other programs can use it as well interoperability document the operation of a program whose documentation is lost or no longer available determine whether a competing product violates one s patents or copyrights
0,passive rfid tags have no power supply the power induced by the reading signal is used to transmit the response
0,because this power is very small passive tags can only be read at distances from about 4 inches 10 cm to a few yards meters depending on the antenna size and type
0,the main advantage of passive tags is that the lack of a battery makes them small lightweight and inexpensive making them ideal for attaching to merchandise they have also been embedded under the skin of pets and in a few cases even people
0,smart cards for use in transit systems and similar applications are also passive the system is activated by tagging or bringing the card near the reader
0,active rfid tags have their own battery
0,their advantage is that they are able to initiate communication with the reader and the signal they send is much stronger more reliable and with greater range up to about 1 500 feet 500 m
0,the stronger signal allows for communication in rougher environments such as outdoors for tracking cattle or shipping containers
0,current uses for rfid tags and cards of various types include automatic fare payments systems for transit systems automatic toll payments for bridges and turnpikes automatic book checkout systems for libraries where it reduces repetitive strain injury rsi in staff and simplifies checking shelves student id cards passports rfid has been included in new u s passports since 2006 tracking cattle including determining the origin of unhealthy animals identification chips placed beneath the skin of pets experimental human rfid implants pioneered by british computer scientist kevin warwick and now used by vip customers in a few nightclubs tracking goods from original shipment to inventory wal mart now requires its major suppliers to include rfid labels with shipments scientific sensors such as seismographic instruments
0,the benefits of rfid technology are numerous better inventory control more secure passports and other forms of id faster easier access to transportation systems and potentially the avoidance of mishaps in hospitals such as the wrong patient receiving a drug or procedure
0,however there are privacy and security concerns that remain to be fully resolved
0,the primary threat is that unauthorized persons could illicitly obtain information or track people or goods for purposes ranging from simple larceny to identity theft
0,privacy rights organizations have also raised concerns that information about consumer purchases could be used for unwanted marketing or sold to third parties while information about a library patron s reading habits could trigger unwarranted government investigations in the name of fighting terrorism
0,there is an incentive to produce rfid cards and tags that are resistant to unauthorized reading or tampering
0,a cryptographic protocol can be used such that no information will be sent or received unless the reader and tag know the correct keys
0,another possibility is to create a device that can jam reading attempts in the device s vicinity perhaps protecting a customer s grocery cart from being scanned
0,finally rfid cards can be put inside in a sleeve of material that blocks the signals
0,however cryptographic and other security technologies raise the cost of rfid devices and may make them impracticable for some applications
0,in september 2006 the national science foundation awarded a 1
0,1 million grant to the rfid consortium for security and privacy to study potential risks and safeguards for the technology
0,that same year a group of major corporations together with the national consumers league released a draft set of standards and guidelines for best practices in using rfid with broader scope than the existing epc electronic product code standard
0,programmers and managers of software development are generally aware of the need for software to properly deal with erroneous data
0,they know that any significant program will have bugs that must be rooted out
0,good software engineering practices and a systematic approach to assuring the reliability and quality of software can minimize problems in the finished product
0,however serious bugs are not always caught and sometimes the consequences can be catastrophic
0,for example in the therac 25 computerized x ray cancer treatment machine poorly thought out command entry routines plus a counter overflow resulted in three patients being killed by massive x ray overdoses
0,the overdoses ultimately occurred because the designers had removed a physical interlock mechanism they believed was no longer necessary
0,any computer application is part of a much larger environment of humans and machines where unforeseen interactions can cause problems ranging from inconvenience to loss of privacy to potential injury or death
0,seeing these potential pitfalls requires thinking beyond the specifications and needs of a particular project
0,for many years the usenet newsgroup comp
0,risks and its collected form risks digest have chronicled what amounts to an ongoing symposium where knowledgeable programmers engineers and others have pointed out potential risks in new technology and suggested ways to minimize them
0,in 1921 the czech playwright karel capek wrote a play called r u r or rossum s universal robots
0,robot is a czech word that has been translated as work er serf or slave
0,in the play the robots which are built by factories to work in other factories eventually revolt against their human masters
0,during the 1960s real robots began to appear in factory settings
0,they were an outgrowth of earlier machine tools that had been programmed by cams and other mechanisms
0,an industrial robot is basically a movable arm that ends in a hand called an end effector
0,the arm and hand can be moved by some combination of hydraulic pneumatic electrical or mechanical means
0,typical applications include assembling parts welding and painting
0,the robot is programmed for a task either by giving it a detailed set of commands to move to grasp and manipulate objects or by training the robot by moving its arm hand and effectors through the required motions which are then stored in the robot s memory
0,by the early 1970s unimation inc had created a profitable business from selling its unimate robots to factories
0,the early industrial robots had very little ability to respond to variations in the environment such as the work piece that the robot was supposed to grasp being slightly out of position
0,however later models have more sophisticated sensors to enable them to adjust to variations and still accomplish the task
0,the more sophisticated computer programs that control newer robots have internal representations or frames of reference to keep track of both the robot s internal parameters angles pressures and so on and external locations in the work area
0,industrial robots work in an extremely restricted environment so their world representation can be quite simple
0,however robots that can move about in the environment have also been developed
0,military programs have developed automatic guided vehicles agvs with wheels or tracks capable of navigating a battlefield and scouting or attacking the enemy
0,space going robots including the sojourner mars rover also have considerable onboard intelligence although their overall tasks are programmed by remote commands
0,indeed the extent to which mobile robots are truly autonomous varies considerably
0,at one end is the robot that is steered and otherwise controlled by its human operator such as law enforcement robots that can be sent into dangerous hostage situations
0,another example is the robots that fight in arena combat in the popular robot warsshows
0,moving toward greater autonomy we have the service robots that have begun to show up in some institutions such as hospitals and laboratories
0,these mobile robots are often used to deliver supplies
0,for example the helpmate robot can travel around a hospital by itself navigating using an internal map
0,it can even take an elevator to go to another floor
0,service robots have had only modest market penetration however
0,they are relatively expensive and limited in function and if relatively low wage more versatile human labor is available it is generally preferred
0,for now mobile robots and service robots are most likely to turn up in specialized applications in environments too dangerous for human workers such as in the military law enforcement handling of hazardous materials and so on
0,ibm did succeed in creating rpg report program generator a language designed to make it easier for programmers including beginners to generate business reports
0,most cobol programs read data perform tests and calculations and print the results
0,rpg first released in 1964 for use with the new system 360 mainframe and the smaller system 3 simplifies this process and eliminates most writing of program code statements
0,a classic rpg program is built around the rpgcycle consisting of three stages
0,during the input stage the input device s file type access specifications and data record structure are specified
0,these specifications can be quite elaborate
0,the heart of the program specifies calculations to be performed with the various data fields while the output section specifies how the results will be laid out in report form including such things as headers footers and sections
0,subsequent versions of rpg added more features
0,rpgiv released in 1994 includes the ability to define subroutines for example
0,ibm has also released visualage rpg which allows for the creation and running of rpg programs in the microsoft windows environment
0,there are also tools for interfacing rpg programs with various database systems and to use rpg for writing web based cgi programs
0,web sites such as news providers and blogs are constantly posting new material
0,while readers can periodically visit a site to look for new material an increasingly popular option is to subscribe to a web feed and receive the latest information automatically
0,the most commonly used tool for web feeds is rss which can stand for really simple syndication rich site summary or rdf site summary depending on the format used
0,the data in an rss feed can include article titles summaries excerpts such as the first paragraph or the complete article or posting
0,feeds can also include multimedia such as graphics video or sound
0,the data and any linked material is formatted using standard markup elements
0,as part of the process of setting up a feed on the web server the feed is published so that it can be found and read using a client program called a reader or aggregator the latter can combine feeds or organize them in a newspaper like format for convenience
0,rss readers can be stand alone applications or be included with many modern web browsers and e mail clients
0,alternatively webbased readers or aggregators such as newsgator online can allow feeds to be read using any web browser
0,readers of web pages can find rss feeds by looking for a subscribe icon or the words rss or xml
0,specialized search engines such as bloglines can also help users find interesting feeds
0,additionally information on the server can also be used by software to automatically deliver the latest content
0,forerunners of rss go back to the mid 1990s with rdf site summary first appearing in 1999 for use on netscape s portal
0,the adoption of rss by the new york times in 2002 greatly aided the popularization of the format as did the growing number of blogs that needed a way for contributors and readers to keep in touch
0,today web browsers such as internet explorer mozilla firefox and safari support rss
0,file sharing services such as bittorrent can be combined with rss to deliver content automatically to users hard drives
0,an offshoot of rss called atom has been less widely adopted but offers better compatibility with xml standards and better management of multimedia content
0,rich text format was developed in the later 1980s by programmers at microsoft
0,its purpose is to allow for interchange of documents between microsoft word and other software while preserving the original formatting
0,an rtf file is itself a plain text file containing the document text enclosed in control codes that determine the formatting
0,although rtf is an 8 bit format special escape sequences can be used to specify 16 bit unicode characters such as for non roman alphabets
0,libraries and utilities are available for reading and writing rtf from most popular programming languages including perl php and ruby
0,in practice rtf created by word processors tends to contain many control codes needed to ensure compatibility with older programs making the files bulky and not practicable to edit directly
0,however saving a file in rtf is a good way to ensure that a document can be used by recipients who may have for example older versions of word
0,ruby is a versatile yet consistent programming language that has become popular in recent years particularly for web development
0,designed by yukihiro matsumoto and first released in 1995 ruby has a compact syntax familiar to many users of perl and other scripting languages avoiding for example the need to declare variable types
0,however ruby is also a thoroughgoing object oriented language somewhat like smalltalk
0,matsumoto has stressed that the design of the language is intended to stress being natural and enjoyable for the programmer rather than focusing on the needs of the machine
0,the most popular programming environment for ruby is ruby on rails an open source application framework aimed particularly at writing programs that connect web sites to databases
0,the framework is based on the model view controller approach separating data access and logic from the user interface and includes scaffolding that can be quickly filled in to provide data driven web sites with basic functionality
0,developers can also create plug ins to extend the built in packages
0,sap nyse symbol sap is a german acronym for systeme anwendungen und produkete in der datenverarbeitung systems applications and products in data processing
0,five former ibm engineers in germany founded the company in 1972
0,although unfamiliar to the american public unlike ibmand microsoft sap is the world s largest business software company and fourth largest software provider in general behind microsoft ibm and oracle
0,the company operates worldwide through three geographical divisions
0,sap specializes in enterprise resource planning erp enhancing a corporation s ability to manage its key assets and needs and to plan for the future
0,this software consists of three tiers the database an application server and the client
0,early versions of this software were designed to run on mainframes
0,other major products include sap netweaver which integrates all other sap modules using modern open standard web technologies customer relationship manager supply chain management supplier relationship management human resource management system product lifestyle managementexchange infrastructure enterprise portal sap knowledge warehouse
0,sap has recognized for some time that while its base of large fortune 500 companies has given it steady income changing trends in business have been limiting the software giant s growth
0,in particular the trend has been toward smaller simpler more scalable applications that can be integrated with modern web services
0,in september 2007 sap announced sap business bydesign a flexible set of enterprise management services that are delivered over the web
0,however it remains to be seen how well sap will be able to compete with more agile companies such as netsuite and salesforce
0,com and whether the company will be able to upgrade its existing large company user base without disaffecting it
0,sap s major competitor in the united states is oracle which has sued sap in 2007 for unfairly downloading and using patches and support materials from oracle and using them to support former oracle customers
0,sap and oracle have generally had quite different growth strategies sap grows by expanding and extending its own products while oracle has grown mainly through acquiring other companies
0,however in october 2007 sap acquired business objects a leader in business intelligence systems for 6
0,8 billion
0,this may signal sap s willingness to engage in further strategic acquisitions
0,in order for a computer to work with information the information must be digitized converted to data that application programs can recognize and manipulate
0,computer users have thus been confronted with the task of converting millions of pages of printed words or graphics into machine readable form
0,since it is expensive to re key text and impractical to redraw images some way is needed to automatically convert the varying shades or colors of the text or images into a digitized graphics image that can be stored in a file
0,this is what a scanner does
0,the scanner head contains a charge coupled device ccd like that used in digital cameras
0,the ccd contains thousands or millions of tiny regions that can convert incoming light into a voltage level
0,each of these voltage levels when amplified will correspond to one pixel of the scanned image
0,a color scanner uses three different diodes for each pixel each receiving light through a red green or blue filter
0,the operation of the head depends on the type of scanner
0,in the most common type the flatbed scanner a motor moves the head back and forth across the paper which lies facedown on a glass window
0,in a sheet fed scanner the head remains stationery and the paper is fed past it by a set of rollers
0,finally there are handheld scanners where the job of moving the scanner head is performed by the user moving the scanner back and forth over the page
0,the resolution of a scanner depends on the number of pixels into which it can break the image
0,the color depth depends on how many bits of information that it can store per pixel more information means more gradations of color or gray
0,resolutions of 2 400 dots per inch dpi or more are now common with up to 36 bit color depth allowing for about 68
0,7 billion colors or gradations besides considerations of resolution and color depth the quality of a scanned image depends on the quality of the scanner s optics as well as on how the page or other object reflects light
0,as anyone who has browsed ebay listings knows the quality of scans can vary considerably
0,most scanners come with software that allows for the scanner to be controlled and adjusted from the pc and image editing software can be used to further adjust the scanned image
0,these general principles also apply to systems where more than one processor is available but there is the added complication of deciding where the scheduling program will be run
0,in a multiprocessing system that has one master and many slave processors the scheduling program runs on the master processor
0,this arrangement is simple but it means that when a slave processor wants to schedule a program it must wait until the scheduling program gets its next time slice on the master processor
0,one alternative is to allow any processor that has free time to run the scheduling algorithm
0,this is harder to set up because it requires a mechanism to make sure two processors do not try to run the scheduling program at the same time but it smoothes out the bottleneck that would arise from relying on a single processor
0,o trends in recent years have changed the emphasis in scheduling algorithms
0,one is the continuing drop in price per unit of processing power and memory
0,this means that maximum efficiency in using the hardware can often give way in favor of catering to the user s convenience and perceptions by giving more priority to interaction with the user
0,the other development is the growing use of systems where much of the burden of graphics and interactivity is placed on the user s desktop thus simplifying the complexity of sch
0,from microbiology to plasma physics modern science would be impossible without the computer
0,this is not because the computer has replaced the scientific method of observation hypothesis and experiment
0,modern scientists essentially follow the same intellectual procedures at did galileo newton darwin and einstein
0,rather understanding of the layered systems that make up the universe has now reached so complex and detailed a level that there is too much data for an individual human mind to grasp
0,further the calculations necessary to process the data usually can t be performed by unaided humans in any reasonable length of time
0,this can be caused either by the inherent complexity of the calculation or the sheer amount of data as in dna sequencing see bioinformatics and data mining
0,even if scientists have a basic understanding of a system it may be hard to determine what the overall results of the interaction of the many particles or other elements in the system will be
0,this is true for example in the analysis of events taking place in nuclear reactors
0,fortunately computers can apply the laws of the system to each of many particles and determine the resulting actions from their aggregate behavior
0,simulation is particularly important in fields where actual experiments are not possible because of distance or time
0,thus a hypothesis about the formation of the universe can be tested by applying it to a set of initial conditions believed to reflect those at or near the time of the big bang
0,however even the most skilled scientists have trouble relating numbers to the shape and interaction of real world objects
0,computers have greatly aided in making it possible to visualize structures and phenomena using high resolution 3d color graphics
0,features of interest can be enhanced and arbitrary false colors can be used to visually show such things as temperature or blood flow
0,these techniques can also be used to create interactive models where scientists can for example combine molecules in new ways and have the computer calculate the likely properties of the result
0,finally computer visualization and modeling can be used both to teach science and to give the general public some visceral grasp of the meaning of scientific theories and discoveries
0,by the mid 1990s many thousands of pages were being added to the world wide web each day
0,the availability of graphical browsing programs such as mosaic netscape and microsoft internet explorer made it easy for ordinary pc users to view web pages and to navigate from one page to another
0,however people who wanted to use the web for any sort of systematic research found they needed better tools for finding the desired information
0,there are basically three approaches to exploring the web casual surfing portals and search engines
0,a user might find or hear about an interesting web page devoted to a business or other organization or perhaps a particular topic
0,the page includes a number of featured links to other pages
0,the user can follow any of those links to reach other pages that might be relevant
0,those pages are likely to have other interesting links that can be followed and so on
0,most web users have surfed in this way it can be fun and it can certainly lead to finds that can be bookmarked for later reference
0,however this approach is not systematic comprehensive or efficient
0,alternatively the user can visit a site such as the famous yahoo
0,started by jerry yang and david filo
0,these sites specialize in selecting what their editors believe to be the best and most useful sites for each topic and organizing them into a multilevel topical index
0,the portal approach has several advantages the work of sifting through the web has already been done the index is easy to use and the sites featured are likely to be of good quality
0,however even yahoo s busy staff can examine only a tiny portion of the estimated 1 trillion or so web pages being presented on about 175 million different web sites as of 2008
0,also the sites selected and featured by portals are subject both to editorial discretion or bias and in some cases to commercial interest
0,the ever growing world wide web consists of billions of linked html documents and other resources but most of the links contain no information about why the linkage has been made or what it might mean
0,services such as google can automatically trace the links and index each page with the aid of metadata such as keywords that summarize page content
0,however discovering the relationships between data items on pages or between pages and their meaning or semantics requires human scrutiny
0,in his 1999 book weaving the web world wide web creator tim berners lee described a new way in which web pages might be organized in the future i have a dream for the web in which computers become capable of analyzing all the data on the web the content links and transactions between people and computers
0,a semantic web which should make this possible has yet to emerge but when it does the day to day mechanisms of trade bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines
0,the intelligent agents people have touted for ages will finally materialize
0,in other words by encoding definitions of objects and their relationships into the text of web pages programs can be written to use this information to answer sophisticated questions such as which devices from this vendor use open source software
0,the semantic web is not something that can appear overnight after all it will take considerable human effort to encode the information needed for machines to understand web resources and additional effort to code the application programs that will take advantage of that information
0,however the potential payoff is huge allowing both human and automated searchers to tackle much more sophisticated tasks
0,for example the university of maryland is developing a prototype semantic search engine called swoogle
0,it can extract information and determine relationships between documents that include rdf or owl elements
0,swoogle can also help users find appropriate ontologies for exploring a subject
0,much research needs to be done
0,for example there is the problem of deriving a measure of reliability or trust based on the data sources used to answer the query which may be scattered all over the world and represent very different kind
0,a growing number of people 50 and older have been learning how to use computer technology and especially applications such as e mail and web browsing
0,however a substantial number of seniors have expressed reluctance to join the digital world as of january 2006 the pew internet american life project found that only 34 percent of persons 65 and over were online
0,some reasons why seniors have avoided the technology include the following the belief that it would be too hard to learn to use it uncertainty about what can be done online and whether it is worth the effort fear of well publicized dangers such as viruses and identity theft the expense of a personal computer and internet accessfortunately a number of these factors are gradually being ameliorated
0,there are numerous books and courses such as at adult education or senior centers that introduce the essentials of computing to seniors
0,properly installed security and filtering software together with some user education can minimize the chances of being victimized online
0,finally internet capable pcs are now available for around 300 or less though the cost of broadband access has not fallen as rapidly as that of hardware
0,there are basically two ways to move data from a computer to or from a peripheral device such as a printer or modem
0,a byte 8 bits of data can be moved all at once with each bit traveling along its own wire
0,alternatively a single wire can be used to carry the data one bit at a time
0,such a connection is called a serial port
0,the serial port receives data a full byte at a time from the computer bus and uses a uart universal asynchronous receiver transmitter to extract the bits one at a time and send them through the port
0,a corresponding circuit at the other end accumulates the incoming bits and reassembles them into data bytes
0,the data bits for each byte are preceded by a start bit to signal the beginning of the data and terminated by an stopbit
0,depending on the application an additional bit may be used for parity
0,devices connected by a serial port must negotiate by requesting a particular connection speed and parity setting
0,failure to agree results in gibberish being received
0,the official standard for serial transmission is called rs232c
0,it defines various additional pins to which wires are connected such as for synchronization specifying when the device is ready to send or receive data and ground
0,physically the old style connectors are called db 25 because they contain 25 pins many of which are not used
0,most newer pcs have db 9 i e nine pin connectors
0,a gender changer can be used in cases where two devices both have male connectors with pins or female connectors with corresponding sockets
0,because they use a single data transmission line and include error correction serial cables can be longer than parallel cables 25 feet or more as opposed to 10 12 feet
0,serial transmission is generally slower at up to 115 200 bits second than parallel transmission
0,serial connections have generally been used for such devices as modems whose speed is already limited by phone line characteristics keyboards mice and some older printers
0,today the faster and more flexible usb is replacing serial connections for many devices including even keyboards
0,in 1982 andrew fuegelman created a program called pc talk
0,this program provided a better way for users with modems to connect to the many bulletin board systems that were starting to spring up
0,fluegelman was familiar with the common practice of public radio and tv broadcasters of soliciting pledge payments to help support their free service
0,he decided to do something similar with his program
0,he distributed it to many bulletin boards where users could download it for free
0,however he asked users who liked the program and wanted to continue to use it to pay him 25
0,fluegelman dubbed his method of software distribution freeware because it cost nothing to try out the program
0,other programmers began to use the same method with their own software
0,this included jim knopf author of the pc file database program and bob wallace who offered pc write as a full featured alternative to expensive commercial word processing program
0,because fluegelman had trademarked the term freeware these other authors began to call their offerings shareware
0,today freeware means software that can be downloaded at no cost and for which there is no charge for continued use
0,the program may be redistributed by users as long as they don t charge for it
0,to see a simple shell in action a windows user need only bring up a command prompt type the word dir and press enter
0,a shell called command
0,com provides the user interface for users of ibm pc compatible systems running ms dos
0,the command processor displays a prompt on the screen
0,it then interprets the user s commands
0,if the command involves one of the shell s internal operations such as dir to list a file directory it simply executes that routine
0,for example the command dir temp pwould be interpreted as a call to execute the dir function passing it the name temp a directory and the p which dir interprets as a switch or instruction telling it to pause the directory listing after each screenful of text
0,if the command is an external ms dos utility such as xcopy a file copying program the shell runs that program passing it the information mainly file names from the command line
0,finally the shell can run any other executable program on the system
0,it is then that program s responsibility to interpret and act upon any additional information that was provided
0,ms dos also has the ability for the command
0,com shell to read a series of commands stored in a text file called a batch file and having the
0,bat batch extension
0,this allowed for rudimentary scripting of system housekeeping operations or other routine tasks
0,a simulation is a simplified but adequate model that represents how a system works
0,the system can be an existing real world one such as a stock market or a human heart or a proposed design for a system such as a new factory or even a space colony
0,if a system is simple enough a cannonball falling from a height for example it is possible to use formulas such as those provided by newton to get an exact answer
0,however many real world systems involve many discrete entities with complex interactions that cannot be captured with a single equation
0,during the 1940s scientists encountered just this problem in attempting to understand what would happen under various conditions in a nuclear reaction
0,together with physicist enrico fermi two mathematicians john von neumann and stanislaw ulam devised a new way to simulate complex systems
0,instead of trying fruitlessly to come up with some huge formula to solve the whole system they applied probability formulas to each of a number of particles in effect rolling the dice for each one and then observing their resulting distribution and behavior
0,because of its analogy to gambling this became known as the monte carlo method
0,it turned out to be widely useful not only for simulating nuclear reactions and particle physics but for many other activities such as bombing raids or the spread of disease where many separate things behave according to probabilities
0,simulations and simulation techniques are used for a tremendous range of applications today
0,besides helping with the understanding of natural systems in physics chemistry biology or engineering simulation techniques are also applied to human behavior
0,for example the behavior of consumers or traders in a stock market can be explored with a simulation based on game theory concepts
0,artificial intelligence techniques such as expert systems can be used to give the individual actors in a simulation more realistic behavior
0,simulations are often used in training
0,a modern flight simulator for example not only simulates the aerodynamics of a plane and its response to the environment and to control inputs but detailed graphics and simulated physical motion can make such training simulations feel very realistic if not quite to star trek holodeck standards
0,whether for flight military exercises or stock trading simulations can provide a much wider range of experiences in a relatively short time than would be feasible or safe using the real world activity
0,simulations can also play an important part in testing software or systems or in predicating the results of business decisions or strategies
0,simulations are also frequently sold as entertainment
0,many commercial strategy and role playing games as well as vehicle simulators contain surprisingly complex simulations that make the games both absorbing and challenging
0,such games can also have considerable educational value
0,some typical features of a smart building include the following lighting that is controlled by time of day scheduling and occupancy sensors temperature and air flow sensors to determine the amount of cooling heating or fresh air needed controls for central heating hot water and air conditioning systems optimizing efficiency and minimizing energy use alarms for intrusion fire carbon monoxide dioxide and other hazards alarms indicating failure or unsafe operating conditions for various devices integration of alarm and status messages with communications systems enabling users to receive them by e mail text message phone or other means
0,the smart card is the next generation of transaction devices
0,magnetically coded credit debit and atm cards have been in use for many years
0,these cards contain a magnetic strip encoded with a small amount of fixed data to identify the account
0,all the actual data such as account balances is kept in a central server which is why credit cards must be validated and transactions approved through a phone modem link
0,some magnetic strip cards such as those used in rapid transit systems are rewritable so that for example the fare for the current ride can be deducted
0,telephone cards work the same way
0,nevertheless these cards are essentially passive tokens containing a small amount of data
0,they have little flexibility
0,however since the mid 1970s it has been possible to put a microprocessor and rewritable memory into a card the size of a standard credit card
0,these smart cards can store a hundred or more times the data of a magnetic strip card
0,further because they have an onboard computer they can interact with a computer at the point of service exchanging and updating information
0,besides the microprocessor and associated circuitry the smart card contains a small amount of ram random access memory to hold scratch data during processing as well as up to 64 kb of rom read only memory containing the card s programming instructions
0,the program is created on a desktop computer and written to the romthat is embedded in the card
0,finally the card includes up to 64 kb of eeprom electrically erasable programmable read only memory for holding account balances and other data
0,this memory is nonvolatile meaning that no power is needed to maintain it and can be erased and rewritten by the card reader
0,contact cards must be swiped through the reader and are most commonly used in retail phone pay tv or health care applications
0,contactless cards need only be brought into the proximity of the reader which communicates with it via radio signals or a low powered laser beam
0,contactless cards are more practical for applications such as collecting bridge tolls
0,the card reader or terminal at the point of sale contains its own computer which runs software that requests particular services from the card s program including providing identifying information and balances updating balances and so on
0,some of the major smartphone manufacturers and their operating systems include the following symbian symbian os used by nokia motorola samsung and others windows mobile enhanced windows ce popular in phones used in asia blackberry rim the popular pda smartphone linux used as the base on which to build a variety of pda phone operating systems including products from motorola palm and nokia maemo os x apple used in apple s innovative and very popular iphone
0,originally standing for simple object access protocol but now no longer an acronym soap is a standard way to access web services
0,in today s web where what appears to users to be a single site or application is usually built from many services such a facility is essential
0,prior to soap web applications usually communicated through remote procedure calls rpc
0,however there were problems with compatibility of applications running under different operating systems and perhaps using different programming languages as well as security problems that often led to such facilities being blocked
0,soap on the other hand uses the same http recognized by all web servers and browsers indeed it can also use secure http
0,a soap request or message is an ordinary xml file that includes an envelope element specifying it to be a soap message an optional header a body element containing the information pertaining to the function or transaction requested and an optional fault element to specify error processing
0,after receiving the message the destination server returns a message providing the requested information
0,today millions of people middle high school and college students but increasingly adults as well have pages on popular web sites such as myspace and facebook
0,these sites are significant examples of social networking the use of web sites and communications and collaboration technology to help people find form and maintain social relationships
0,the origins of social networking can be traced to online venues that arose in the 1970s and 1980s notably usenet and later online chat boards
0,in the late 1990s social networking web sites began to appear including classmates
0,com helping people find and communicate with former schoolmates and sixdegrees
0,com which emphasized knows someone who knows someone who
0,kinds of links
0,by the mid 2000s the two biggest sites were facebook and myspace
0,founded in 2006 by mark zuckerberg facebook was originally restricted to harvard students but eventually became open to any college student and then high schools and even places of employment
0,the name comes from a book given to incoming students in some schools to familiarize them with their peers
0,as of late 2007 facebook had more than 55 million active members and had become the seventh most visited of all web sites
0,social scientists can use a variety of software throughout the research process
0,for example researchers might use the following web and bibliographical search tools to find existing research on their topic note taking and concept diagramming mind mapping software software to conduct polls or surveys and compile the results social networking analysis to better understand a group s structure and dynamics statistical analysis tools to analyze the findings map based systems for studying geographical aspects modeling software to simulate the mechanism being studied using mathematical techniques such as the monte carlo and markov chain methods
0,in general the overall steps in developing a program are detailed specification of what the program will be required to do
0,this can include developing a prototype and getting user s reaction to it
0,creation of a suitable program architecture algorithm s and the data types objects or other structures needed to implement them
0,coding writing the program language statements that implement the structure
0,verification and testing of the program using realistic data and field testing
0,
0,maintenance or the correction of errors and adding of requested minor features short of creating a new version of the program
0,sony corporation nyse symbol sne is the electronics business unit of sony group a large japanese multinational company that plays a leading role in worldwide electronics games and entertainment media movies and music introducing and shaping many now familiar standards
0,the company traces its origin to a radio repair shop started by masaru ibuka in a bombed out building in tokyo in 1945
0,he was soon joined by akio morita and the men started an electronics company whose name translates in english to tokyo telecommunications engineering corporation
0,they started by building tape recorders but in the early 1950s the two entrepreneurs were among the earliest to realize the potential of the transistor marketing transistor radios starting in 1956
0,the devices essentially established the modern consumer electronics field perfectly fitting with a new music fad among american teenagers rock and roll
0,with their marketing success ibuka and morita realized that they needed a simple catchy name that would appeal to americans and other non japanese customers
0,in 1958 they came up with sony
0,although the name did not exist in any language and thus could be made proprietary sony evokes english words such as sound and sonic
0,it also resembled a japanese slang phrase sony sony for something like what we would call geeks or nerds today
0,the company s successful consumer products have included the following trinitron tubes for televisions and computer monitors no longer sold in the united states walkman portable music player 1979 3

0,in 1994 the company introduced the playstation followed by later models in 2000 and 2006
0,sony is also a significant seller of digital cameras including the mavica floppy disc later cd since discontinued
0,the company also introduced its proprietary memory stick for storage
0,the simplest and least efficient kind of sort is called the selection sort
0,rather like a bridge player organizing a hand the selection sort involves finding the record with the lowest key and swapping it with the first record then scanning back through for the next lowest key and swapping it with the second record and so on until all the records are sorted
0,while this uses memory very efficiently since the records are sorted in place it is not only slow but also gets worse fast
0,that is the time taken to sort n records is proportional to n2
0,the selection approach suffers because on each pass the sort determines not only the record with the lowest key but 446
0,
0,sorting and searchingthe one with the next lowest key
0,however that information is not retained
0,the heapsort invented by john williams in 1964 uses a binary tree to store a heap of sorted records
0,once the heap is built the tree nodes can be used to store record numbers in a corresponding array that will represent the sorted database
0,the heapsort is efficient because no records are physically moved and the only memory needed is for the heap and array
0,the heapsort is generally considered the fastest and most reliable general purpose sorting algorithm with a maximum running time of log n
0,the bubble sort is based on making comparisons and swaps
0,it makes the most convenient comparison possible each record with its neighbor
0,the algorithm looks at the first two records
0,if the second has a lower key than the first the records are swapped
0,the procedure continues with the second and third records then the third and fourth and so on through all the records swapping pairs of adjacent records whenever they are out of order
0,after one pass the record with highest key will have bubbled up to the end of the list
0,the procedure is then repeated for all but the last record until the two highest records are at the end and so on until all the records are sorted
0,unfortunately the number of comparisons and swaps that must be made makes the bubble sort as slow as the selection sort
0,the quicksort improves on the basic bubble sort by first choosing a record with a key approximately midway between the lowest and highest
0,this key is called the pivot
0,the records are then moved to the left of the pivot if they are lower than it and to the right if higher that is the records are divided into two partitions
0,the process is then repeated to split the left side with a new pivot and then the right side likewise
0,this is continued until the partition size is one and the records are now all sorted
0,because of this repeated partitioning quicksort is usually implemented using a procedure that calls itself repeatedly see recursion
0,devised by c a r hoare in 1962 quicksort is much faster than the bubble sort because records are moved over greater distances in a single operation rather than simply being exchanged with their neighbors
0,assuming an appropriate initial pivot value is chosen running time is proportional to the logarithm of n rather than to the square of n the difference becomes dramatic as the size of the database increases
0,the bubble sort and quicksort are designed to work with records that are in random order
0,however in many applications a database grows slowly over time
0,at any given time the existing database is already sorted so it hardly makes sense to have to resort the whole database each time a new record is added
0,instead an insertion sort can be used
0,in its simplest form the algorithm looks sequentially through the sorted records until it finds the first record whose key is higher than that of the new record
0,the new record can then be inserted just before that record much like the way a bridge player might organize the cards in a hand
0,since inserting a record and physically moving all the higher records up in memory can be time consuming a linked list of key values and associated record number is often used instead
0,see list processing
0,that way only the links need to be changed rather than any records being moved
0,the insertion sort was improved by donald l shell in 1959
0,his shellsort takes a recursive approach like that in the quicksort and applies the insertion sort procedure to successively smaller partitions
0,another improvement on the insertion sort is the mergesort
0,as the name implies this approach begins by creating two small lists of sorted records using a simple comparison algorithm then merging the lists into longer lists
0,merging is accomplished by looking at the two keys on the top of two lists and taking whichever is lowest until the lists are exhausted
0,the merge sort also lends itself to a recursive approach and it is comparable in speed and stability to the heapsort
0,all of the sorting algorithms discussed so far rely upon some form of comparison
0,however it also possible to sort records by calculating their relative positions or distribution
0,in its simplest form an array can be created whose range of indexes is equal to 1 to the maximum possible key value
0,each key is then stored in the index position equal to its value that is a record with a key of 2314 would be stored in the array at position array 2314
0,this procedure works well but only if the keys are all integers the range is small enough to fit in memory and there are no duplicate keys since a duplicate would in effect overwrite the record already stored in that position
0,a more practical approach is to use a formula hash function that should create a unique hash value for each key
0,the function must be chosen to minimize collisions where two keys end up with the same hash value which creates the same problem as with duplicate keys
0,a hash sort is quite efficient within those constraints
0,there are a number of ways that sound can be sampled stored or generated digitally
0,here we will look at some of the most popular sound file formats
0,wavthe wav wave file format is specific to microsoft windows
0,it essentially stores the raw sample data that represents the digitized audio content including information about the sampling rate which in turns affects the sound quality
0,since wav files are not compressed they can consume considerable disk space
0,aiffaiff stands for audio interchange file format and is specific to the apple macintosh and to silicon graphics sgi platforms
0,like wav it stores actual sound sample data
0,a variant aiff c can store compressed sound
0,authe au audio file format was developed by sun microsystems and is used mainly on unix systems and also in java programming
0,midimidi stands for musical instrument digital interface
0,unlike most other sound formats midi files don t represent sampled sound data
0,rather they represent virtual musical instruments that synthesize sound according to complex algorithms that attempt to mirror the acoustic characteristics of real pianos guitars or other instruments
0,since midi is like a score for the virtual instruments rather than storing the sounds it is much more compact than sampled sound formats
0,midi is generally used for music composition rather than casual listening
0,mp3mp3 is actually a component of the mpeg moving picture expert group multimedia standard and stands for mpeg1 audio layer 3
0,it is now the most popular sound format using compression to provide a balance of sound quality
0,while spam can appear in any communications medium including chat instant messaging and even blogs the most prevalent type is e mail spam which costs u s businesses billions of dollars a year in processing expenditures lost time and damage caused by malicious software malware for which spam can be either a delivery vehicle or an inducement
0,in 2007 an estimated 90 billion spam messages were sent each day
0,the fundamental driving force of spam is the fact that given one has internet access sending e mail costs essentially nothing no matter how many messages are sent
0,thus even if only a tiny number of people respond to a spam solicitation such as for sexual enhancement products the result is almost pure profit for the spammer
0,besides directly making fraudulent solicitations for products that are ineffective counterfeit or nonexistent spam carries two other dangers inducements to click to visit fake web sites and attachments containing viruses or other dangerous software
0,ways to stop the spread of spam include the following e mail filtering software using a combination of text analysis by keyword or statistical correlation and lists of internet locations domains associated with spamming filtering can be done both by service providers and individual users or collaboratively tightening the technical requirements for messages to be accepted by mail servers much spam has poorly formatted headers improving techniques for blocking the viruses used by spammers to set up their bots see computervirus and firewall attempting to shut down the infrastructure that supports spam operations such as hosts who allow e mail and sellers of spamming software and illicitly gathered address lists
0,spyware and adware are two pervasive threats to computer users
0,both are programs that are installed more or less surreptitiously often accompanying an attractive looking free software package or media download
0,depending on how widely it is defined as many as eight out of 10 pcs may be infected by some sort of spyware
0,signs of infection can include the system slowing down or periodically freezing web browsers that fail to display the expected home page or search results and the appearance of numerous unwanted pop up windows a sign of adware
0,ranging from least to most harmful spyware and adware can do the following display annoying advertising that can clog up the screen or cover up information some adware can also be spyware that uses information about the user to target advertising track web browsing to provide information to sell to marketers obtain personal information for use in identity theft install keyloggers programs that record keystrokes such as passwords being entered or other back door or trojan programs
0,growing concern about spyware has prompted the use of antispyware programs such as ad aware and spybot search destroy as well as a free program from microsoft
0,antispyware programs are also being included in popular security suites from companies such as symantec and mcafee
0,the programs work similarly to antivirus programs watching for suspicious behavior or signatures matching known spyware or adware
0,depending on the program the spyware can be blocked from executing at all or removed from the system
0,the software varies considerably in effectiveness so users may have to run several different programs to completely remove an infestation
0,spyware has been generally given a lower priority than viruses or even spam
0,when challenged spyware makers generally claim that the user authorized its installation at least implicitly by installing the utility or other software that contains it
0,although antispyware legislation has been introduced in congress it has not passed as of mid 2008
0,however state officials such as former new york state attorney general eliot spitzer successfully sued a spyware company winning a 7
0,5 million settlement
0,a stack is simply a list that represents successive locations in memory into which data can be inserted
0,the operation of a stack can be visualized as being rather like the springloaded platform onto which dishes are stacked for washing in some restaurants
0,as each dish number is added the stack is pushed
0,because only the item on top the last one added can be removed popped at any given time a stack is described as a lifo last in first out structure
0,note that this is different from a queue where items can be added or removed from either end see queue
0,stacks are useful whenever nested items must be tracked
0,for example a procedure might call a procedure that in turn calls another procedure
0,the stack can keep track of the parameters as well as the calling address for each pending procedure
0,stacks can also be used to evaluate nested arithmetic expressions
0,web users increasingly have access to such content as news broadcasts songs and even full length videos
0,the problem is that the user must receive the content in real time at a steady pace not in sputters or jerks
0,however factors such as load on the web server and network congestion between the server and user can cause delays in transmission
0,one way to reduce the problem would be to compress the data
0,however excessive compression would compromise audio or picture quality to an unacceptable extent
0,fortunately a technology called streaming offers a way to smooth out the transmission of large amounts audio or video content
0,when a user clicks on an audio or video link the player software or web browser plug in is loaded and the transmission begins
0,typically the player stores a few seconds of the transmission so any momentary delays in the transmission of data packets will not appear as the data starts to play
0,assuming the rate of transmission remains sufficient enough data remains in the buffer so that data can be fed to the playing software at a steady pace
0,if however there is too much delay due to network congestion the playback will pause while the player refills its buffer
0,founded in 1982 sun microsystems nasdaq symbol java has played an important role in the development of computer workstations and servers unix based operating systems and the java programming language
0,during the 1980s sun was known mainly for its workstations for programmers and graphics professionals running on its own sparc series microprocessors
0,however 460
0,
0,structured programmingby the 1990s the growing power of regular desktop pcs was reducing the need for special purpose workstations
0,as the web grew starting in the 1990s sun s line of multiprocessing web servers became quite successful though the dotbust of the early 2000s cut revenues
0,one of sun s founders was a key developer of unixsoftware
0,sun developed its own version of unix sunos for its workstations in the 1980s and then joined with at t to develop the widely used unix system v release 4 which in turn became the basis for sun s new operating system solaris
0,sun has also supported the use of linux on its hardware
0,supercomputers are always more expensive and somewhat less reliable than standard computers so they are used only when necessary
0,as the power of standard computers continues to grow applications that formerly required a multimillion dollar supercomputer can now run on a desktop workstation a good example is the creation of detailed 3d graphics
0,on the other hand there are always applications that will soak up whatever computing power can be brought to bear on them
0,these include analysis of new aircraft designs weather and climate models the study of nuclear reactions and the creation of models for the synthesis of proteins
0,the neverending battle of organizations such as the national security agency nsa to monitor worldwide communications and crack ever tougher encryption also demands the fastest available supercomputers
0,the term supply chain management was developed in the 1980s to refer to the systematic efforts to improve the efficiency and reliability of this vital business activity
0,although the details will vary with the industry a supply chain can include the following activities obtaining the raw materials or components needed for the product manufacturing finished products marketing the product distributing the product to retailers or other outlets servicing the product and supporting customers increasingly providing for the ultimate recycling or disposal of the product
0,a system administrator is the person responsible for managing the operations of a computer facility to ensure that it runs properly meets user needs and protects the integrity of users data
0,such facilities range from offices with just a few users to large campus or corporate facilities that may be served by a large staff of administrators
0,the system administrator s responsibilities often include setting up accounts for new users allocating computing resources such as server space among users configuring the file database or local area network lan servers installing new or upgraded software on users workstations keeping up with new versions of the operating system and networking software using various tools to monitor the performance of the system and to identify potential problems such as device bottlenecks or a shortage of disk space ensuring that regular backups are made configuring network services such as e mail internet access and the intranet local tcp ip network using tools such as firewalls and virus scanners to protect the system from viruses hacker attacks and other security threats providing user orientation and training creating and documenting policies and procedures
0,the systems analyst serves as the bridge between the needs of the user and the capabilities of the computer system
0,the systems analyst goes into action when users request that some new application or function be provided usually in a corporate computing environment
0,the first step is to define the user s requirements and to prepare precise specifications for the program
0,in doing so the systems analyst is aided by methodologies developed by computer scientists over the last several decades
0,often flowcharts or other aids are used to help visualize the operation of the program
0,after communicating with the user the systems analyst must then communicate with the programmers helping them understand what is needed and reviewing their work as they begin to design the program
0,although the systems analyst may do little actual programming he or she must be familiar with programming tools and practices
0,this may make it possible to suggest existing software or components that could be adapted instead of undertaking the cost and time involved with creating a new program
0,as a program is developed systems analysts are often responsible for designing tests to ensure that the software works properly
0,applications programmers write programs to help users work better while systems programmers write programs to help the computer itself work better
0,systems programmers generally work for companies in the computer industry that develop operating systems network facilities program language compilers and other software development tools utilities and device drivers
0,however systems programmers can also work for applications developers to help them interface their programs to the operating system or to devices
0,modern operating systems are highly complex so systems programmers tend to specialize in particular areas
0,these might include device drivers software development tools program language libraries applications programming interfaces apis and utilities for monitoring system conditions and resources
0,systems programmers develop the infrastructure needed for networking as well as multiple processor computers and distributed computing systems
0,systems programmers also play a key role when an application program must be ported to a different platform or simply modified to run under a new version of the operating system
0,as the name suggests a tablet pc is a small computer about the size of a notebook not to be confused with a notebook pc which is a small light laptop
0,the user can write on the screen with a stylus to take notes for similar functionality see graphics tablet draw and make selections with stylus or fingertip
0,if the user writes on the screen software converts the writing to the appropriate characters and stores them in a file
0,as with some pdas there may also be a system of shorthand gestures that can be used to write more quickly
0,alternatively the user can type with stylus or fingertips on a virtual keyboard displayed on the screen
0,a more versatile and natural interface is becoming available multitouch pioneered by the apple iphone and microsoft surface can recognize multiple motions and pressure points simultaneously
0,this allows the user to for example flick the finger to turn a page or use a pinching motion to pick up an object
0,applications for tablet pcs include many pda type applications field note taking inventory and other tasks that require a device that is not encumbering
0,because of its compactness a tablet pc can also be a good reader for ebooks
0,an interesting variant is the internet tablet best known in nokia s n series
0,these are smaller and lighter than a tablet pc
0,the nokia n810 for example has a slide out keyboard as well as a virtual screen keyboard
0,the most notable feature is the internet browser and related applications such as e mail and instant messaging and built in wireless connections
0,although there is no phone internet based services such as skype can be used to place calls or a bluetooth equipped mobile phone
0,the nokia series uses a variant of linux and can run a large variety of open source applications
0,anyone who has seen computers in old movies is familiar with the row of large freestanding tape cabinets with their spinning reels of tape
0,the visual cue that the computer was running consisted of the reels thrashing back and forth vigorously while rows of lights flashed on the computer console
0,magnetic tape was indeed the mainstay for data storage in most large computers in the 1950s through the 1970s
0,in early mainframes the main memory corresponding to today s ram chips consisted of core thousands of tiny magnetized rings crisscrossed with wires by which they could be set or read
0,because core memory was limited to a few thousand bytes kb it was used only to hold the program instructions and to store temporary working data while the program was running
0,the source data to be processed by the program was read from a reel of tape on the drive
0,if the program updated the data rather than just reporting on it it would generally write a new tape with the revised data
0,in large facilities a person called a tape librarian was in charge of keeping the reels of tape organized and providing them to the computer operators as needed
0,by the 1990s pc users generally used tapes only for making backups
0,a typical backup tape drive uses dat digital audio tape cartridges that hold from hundreds of megabytes to several gigabytes of data
0,most drives use a rotating assembly of four heads two read and two write that verify data as it s being written
0,as a backup medium tape has a lower cost per gigabyte than disk devices
0,it is easy to use and can be set up to run unattended except for periodically changing cartridges
0,however since tapes are written and read sequentially they are not convenient for restoring selected files
0,many smaller installations now prefer using a second mirror hard drive as backup using disk arrays or using recordable cds or optical drives for smaller amounts of data
0,many large companies and government agencies have thousands of reels of tape stored away in their vaults since the 1960s including data returned from early nasa space missions
0,as time passes it becomes increasingly difficult to guarantee that this archived data can be successfully read
0,this is due both to gradual deterioration of the medium and the older data formats becoming obsolete
0,tcl includes a number of extensions that for example provide access to popular database formats such as mysql and can interface with other programming languages such as c and java
0,the most widely used extension is tk which provides a library for creating user interfaces for a variety of operating systems and languages such as perl python and ruby
0,tcl has been described as a glue to connect existing applications
0,it is relatively easy to write and test a script interactively often at the command line and then insert it into the code of an application
0,when the application runs the tcl interpreter runs the script whose output can then be used by the main application
0,the header information also includes the total length of the packet
0,in theory packets can be as large as 65 kbytes in practice they are limited to a smaller maximum
0,an identification number that can be used if a packet is broken into smaller pieces for efficiency in transmission
0,this allows the packet to be reassembled at the destination
0,a time to live value that specifies how many hops movements from one intermediate host to another the packet will be allowed to take
0,this is reduced by 1 for each hop
0,if it reaches 0 the packet is assumed to have gotten lost or stale and is discarded
0,a protocol number the protocol is usually tcp see below
0,a checksum for checking the integrity of the header itself not the data in the packet
0,the source and destination addresses
0,the source and destination are given as ip addresses which are 32 bits long and typically written as four sets of up to three numbers each for example 208
0,162

0,most software companies now have web sites that include a support section that offers services such as frequently asked questions faq files with answers to common problems
0,a searchable knowledge base of articles relating to various aspects of the software including compatibility with other products operating system issues and so on
0,forms or e mail links that can be used to submit questions to the company
0,typically questions are answered in one or two working days
0,a bulletin board where users can share solutions and tips relating to the software
0,web sites for publications such as pc magazine and zdnet also offer articles and other resources for working with the various versions of microsoft windows and popular applications
0,as millions of people became new computer users during the 1980s a thriving computer book publishing industry offered users a more user friendly approach than that usually provided in the manuals issued by the software companies
0,the dummies books offering bite sized servings of information written in a breezy style and accompanied by cartoons eventually spread beyond computers into hundreds of other fields and the format was then copied by other publishers
0,publishers such as sams coriolis and particularly o reilly have aimed their offerings at more experienced users programmers and multimedia developers
0,computer trade books are often written by experienced developers and systems programmers who can offer advanced knowledge and tips and tricks to their less experienced colleagues
0,since many technical gurus are not experienced writers the best results often come from collaboration between the expert and an experienced technical writer and or editor who can review the material for completeness organization and clarity
0,in recent years there has been some contraction in the computer book industry
0,this has arisen from several sources improved on line help included in products the dominance of many applications areas by a handful of products and fewer people needing beginner level instructions
0,many technical writers work within software companies or in the information systems departments of other corporations universities or government agencies
0,their work is generally more highly structured than that of the manual or book writer
0,as part of a development team a technical writer may be in charge of creating documentation describing the data structures classes and functions within the program
0,this task is aided by a variety of tools including facilities for extracting such information automatically from c or java programs
0,the writer may also be responsible for maintaining logs that show each change or addition made to the program during each compiled version or build
0,this type of technical writing requires detailed knowledge of operating systems programming languages software development tools and software engineering methodology
0,it also requires the ability to work well as part of a team often under conditions of high pressure
0,major policy issues involving information technology industries include foreign trade and the protection of intellectual property attempts to reform the patent system to prevent what is seen as dubious and expensive litigation the need for an increasing number of trained workers and providing a sufficient number of visas for foreign workers preserving equal access to the internet which pits content providers against telecommunications companies promoting the development of a next generation internet infrastructure internet 2 government support for computer research such as through the national science foundation see government funding of computer research favorable treatment of online businesses with regard to taxation often objected to by traditional brickand mortar businesses see e commerce laws against computer related fraud and other crime privacy regulations the computer industry is also involved in issues that will affect its future over the longer term such as the need to improve math and science education in elementary and high schools energy and environmental policy and issues such as health care and pensions that affect all sectors of the economy
0,prior to the court ordered breakup of at t in 1984 the phone industry functioned in a monolithic way and was not very responsive to the needs of the growing computer networking industry
0,the breakup of at t led to growing competition providing a wider variety of telecommunications equipment and lower phone rates just as pc users were starting to buy modems and sign up with online services and bulletin boards
0,the growing deregulation movement in the 1990s culminating in the telecommunications act of 1996 furthered this process by opening cable and broadcast television radio and other wireless communication to competition
0,with more than half of american internet users on high speed connections the delivery of communications and media over the net can only grow
0,wireless and mobile services satellite cell network and 802
0,11 see wireless computing have also been growing vigorously
0,the result is that the information highway now has many lanes with some being express lanes
0,telecommuting also called telework is the ability to work from home or from some location other than the main office
0,according to a report by the nonprofit organization worldatwork 28
0,7 million people worked from home at least one day a month in 2006
0,self employed persons of course have a much higher rate of working from home
0,telecommuting was made possible by the growing capabilities of home computers and the availability of network connections that allow the worker at home to have access to most of the people and facilities that would be available if the worker were on site
0,workers and companies that promote telecommuting often cite the following advantages elimination of stressful time wasting commutes workers may be more productive because they have fewer office distractions unnecessary meetings etc
0,reduction of traffic air pollution and fuel costs greater flexibility in working hours the ability of working parents with small children to combine child care and work to some extent reduction of costs associated with office facilities
0,some of the problems or disadvantages cited include worker productivity may decrease due to lack of sufficient discipline and workers becoming distracted at home
0,
0,managers may have trouble keeping track of or evaluating the activities of workers who are not physically present
0,telecommuters may miss critical information and go out of the loop
0,security can be compromised particularly through theft of laptops containing sensitive personal data
0,possible legal liabilities and application of osha rules to home working situations
0,the alternative is to connect the remote participant to a mobile robot this is sometimes called telerobotics
0,such robots already exist although their capabilities are limited and they are not yet widely used for meetings
0,rodneybrooks director of the mit artificial intelligence laboratory foresees a not very distant future in which such robots will be commonplace
0,the robot will have considerable built in capabilities so the person who has roboted in to it won t need to worry about the mechanics of walking avoiding obstacles or focusing vision on particular objects
0,seeing and acting through the robot the person will be able to move around an environment as freely as persons who are physically present
0,the operator can give general commands amounting to walk over there or pick up this object or perform more delicate manipulations by using his or her hands to manipulate gloves connected to a force feedback mechanism
0,brooks sees numerous applications for robotic telepresence
0,for example someone at work could robot in to his or her household robot and do things such as checking to make sure appliances are on or off respond to a burglar alarm or even refill the cat s food dish
0,robotic telepresence could also be used to bring expertise such as that of a surgeon to any site around the world without the time and expense of physical travel
0,indeed robots may be the only way for the foreseeable future that humans are likely to explore environments far beyond earth
0,the term template is used in a several contexts in computing but they all refer to a general pattern that can be customized to create particular products such as documents
0,in a word processing program such as microsoft word a template sometimes called a style sheet is a document that comes with a particular set of styles for various elements such as titles headings first and subsequent paragraphs lists and so on
0,each style in turn consists of various characteristics such as type font type style such as bold and spacing
0,the template also includes properties of the document as a whole such as margins header and footer
0,to create a new document the user can select one of several built in templates for different types of documents such as letters faxes and reports or design a custom template by defining appropriate styles and properties
0,special sequences of programmed actions can also be attached to a template
0,templates can be created and used for applications other than word processing
0,a spreadsheet template consists of appropriate macros and formulas in an otherwise blank spreadsheet
0,when it is run the template prompts the user to enter the appropriate values and then the calculations are performed
0,a database program can have input forms that serve in effect as templates for creating new records by inputting the necessary data
0,the primary use of text editors today is to create programs and scripts
0,these must generally be created using only standard ascii characters without all the embedded formatting commands and graphics found in word processing documents
0,programmer s text editors can be very sophisticated in their own right providing features such as built in syntax checking and formatting or as with the emacs editor the ability to program the editor itself
0,ultimately however program editors must create a source code file that can be processed by the compiler
0,text editors are also useful for writing quick short scripts and can be handy for writing html code for the web
0,however many web pages are now designed using word processor like programs that convert the wysiwyg what you see is what you get formatting into appropriate html codes automatically
0,although they use different devices and formats text messaging on cell phones and pdas and instant messaging through online services have much in common
0,both involve sending short messages to other users who can receive them and reply as soon as they are online
0,this is an ad hoc connection that differs from a chat room see chat online in that the latter is an established location where people go to converse with other members
0,it also differs from an online discussion group see conferencing systems and netnews and newsgroups where messages are posted and may be replied to later but there is no real time communication
0,text messaging or texting uses a protocol called short message service sms which is available with most cell phones and service plans as well as pdas that have wireless connections
0,when a user sends a message to a designated recipient it goes to a service center where it is routed to the destination phone if that phone is not connected the message is stored and retried later
0,typically messages are limited to 160 characters though up to six or so messages can be concatenated and treated as a longer message
0,while texting did not become popular until the late 1990s instant messaging began in the 1970s as a way for multiple users on a shared computer or network such as a unix system to communicate in real time using commands such as send and talk the latter being more conversational see chat online
0,in the late 1980s and early 1990s various dial up services provided for sending text messages aol was the first to use the term instant messages for its facility
0,by the mid 1990s instant messaging was well established on the internet often employing a graphical user interface as with icq and aol instant messenger aol later acquired icq as well
0,between 2000 and 2004 the numbers of text messages sent worldwide soared from 17 billion to 500 billion
0,at about a dime a message texting became a major source of revenue for phone companies
0,since then texting has continued to grow particularly in parts of europe the asia pacific region particularly china and japan where it has largely become an internet based service
0,in the united states texting is most popular among teenagers
0,it is not uncommon to see a bench full of teens talking excitedly to one another while carrying on simultaneous texting with unseen friends in what to many adult onlookers appears to be an incomprehensible code their conversation perhaps ending with ttyl talk to you later
0,loosely affiliated groups communicating by text have organized everything from happenings to serious protest campaigns as in the anti wto world trade organization demonstrations in seattle in 1999 and in the philippines uprising in 2001
0,as the name implies a touchscreen is a screen display that can respond to various areas being touched or pressed
0,invented in 1971 the first form of touchscreens to become part of daily life were found on automatic teller machines atms and point of sale credit card processors
0,touchscreens can detect the pressure of a finger or stylus in several ways a resistive touchscreen uses two layers of electrically conductive metallic material separated by a space
0,when an area is touched the two layers are electrically connected and the change in electrical current is registered and converted to a code that identifies the location touched
0,surface acoustic wave saw touchscreens use an ultrasonic wave that is interrupted by a touch capacitive touchscreens respond to the change in electron storage capacitance caused by contact with a human body
0,various other acoustic mechanical strain based or optical systems can also be used with the latter being particularly popular
0,many computer applications involve the arrival of a set of data that must be processed in a specified way
0,for example a bank s atm system receives a customer s request to deposit money together with identification of the account and the amount to be deposited
0,the system must accept the deposit update the account balance and return a receipt to the customer
0,this is an example of real time transaction processing
0,some applications process transactions in batches
0,for example a company may run a program once a month that generates paychecks and withholding stubs from employee records that include hours worked number of dependents claimed and so on
0,indeed in the atm example the account balance is typically not updated during the on line transaction but instead a batch transaction is stored
0,overnight that transaction will be processed together with other transactions affecting that account such as checks and the balance will then be officially updated
0,the program module that keeps track of the progress of transactions is called a transaction monitor
0,the tree is a data structure that consists of individual intersections called nodes
0,the tree normally starts with a single root node
0,unlike real trees data trees have their root at the top and branch downward
0,the root connects to one or more nodes which in turn branch into additional nodes often through a number of levels
0,a node that branches downward from another node is called that node s childnode
0,a node at the bottom that does not branch any further is called a terminal node or sometimes a leaf
0,trees are useful for expressing many sorts of hierarchical structures such as file systems where the root of a disk holds folders that in turn can hold files or additional folders and so on down many levels
0,a corporate organization chart is a noncomputer example of a hierarchical tree
0,a binary tree is a tree in which no node has more than two child nodes
0,to move through data stored in a binary tree a program can use two pointers one to the current node s left child and one to its right child
0,the pointers can then be used to trace the paths through the nodes
0,if the tree represents a file that has been sorted comparing nodes to the desired value and branching accordingly quickly leads to the desired record
0,alternatively the data can be stored directly in contiguous memory locations corresponding to the successive numbers of the nodes
0,this method is faster than having to trace through successive pointers and a binary search algorithm can be applied directly to the stored data
0,on the other hand it is easier to insert new items into a linked list
0,a common solution is to combine the two structures storing the linked list in a contiguous range of memory by storing its root in the middle of the range its left child at the beginning of the range its right child at the end and then repeatedly splitting each portion of the range to store each level of children
0,intuitively one can see that algorithms for processing such stored trees will take a recursive approach
0,the more than five century old art of typography the design arrangement and setting of printing type was transformed in the latter part of the 20th century by digital technology
0,with the exception of some traditional presses devoted to the fine book market nearly all type used today is designed and set by computer
0,most users are familiar with the typefaces distributed with their operating system and software such as the popular adobe and truetype
0,many such font designs are based on and sometimes named after traditional typefaces modified for readability using typical displays and printers
0,for control of composition there are three overlapping levels of software ranging from easiest to use but most limited to most complex versatile and precise
0,modern word processors such as microsoft word and open office provide enough control for many types of shorter documents
0,desktop publishing software adds facilities suitable for layout of fliers brochures newsletters and similar publications that often mix text and graphics
0,more elaborate documents such as books magazines and newspapers require more sophisticated facilities to control the layout and flow of text
0,some traditional choices include latex for the tex typesetting program used particularly by scientists and other academics and the older troff and its offshoots on unix systems
0,more recent programs include quark framemaker pagemaker and indesign
0,related utilities often used in digital typography include font editors for design and modification and utilities to convert fonts from one format to another
0,ubiquitous or pervasive computing focuses not on individual computers and tasks but on a world where most objects including furniture and appliances have the ability to communicate information
0,this has also been called the internet of things
0,this can be viewed as the third phase in a process where the emphasis has gradually shifted from individual desktops 1980s to the network and internet 1990s to mobile presence and the ambient environmentsome examples of ubiquitous computing might include picture frames that display pictures attuned to the user s activities dashboard devices that can be set to display changing information such as weather and stock quotes parking meters that can provide verbal directions to nearby attractions kiosks or other facilities to provide verbal cues to guide travelers such as through airports home monitoring systems that can sense and deal with accidents or health emergencies
0,the essential core of the unix system is the kernel which provides facilities to organize and access files move data to and from devices and control the running of programs processes
0,in designing unix thompson deliberately kept the kernel small noting that he wanted maximum flexibility for users
0,since the kernel was the only part of the system that could not be reconfigured or replaced by the user he limited it to those functions that reliability and efficiency dictated be handled at the system level
0,another way in which the unix kernel was kept simple was through device independence
0,this meant that instead of including specific instructions for operating particular models of terminal printers or plotters within the kernel generic facilities were provided
0,these could then be interfaced with device drivers and configuration files to control the particular devices
0,a unix system typically has many users each of whom may be running a number of programs
0,the interface that processes user commands is called the shell
0,it is important to note that in unix a shell is just another program so there can be and are many different shells reflecting varying tastes and purposes
0,traditional unixshells include the bourne shell sh c shell csh and korn shell ksh
0,modern unix systems can also have graphical user interfaces similar to those found on windows and macintosh personal computers
0,traditional print and broadcast media divide the world into two groups content producers and content consumers
0,however as noted by its creator tim berners lee at its very beginning the world wide web had at least the potential for users to take an active role in linking existing content and contributing their own
0,indeed berners lee wanted web client software to include not only browsing functions but easy ways for users to create their own web pages
0,in reality early users faced something of a learning curve usually having to cope with html to some extent for example
0,but by the mid 2000s a variety of new media of communication had become readily accessible using an ordinary web browser at sites that host the required software
0,the most prominent applications are blogs and wikis particularly wikipedia
0,meanwhile inexpensive digital still and video cameras and easy to use editing software encouraged people to make their own media creations
0,sites to enable users to upload share and comment on their creations have flourished
0,the growth of sites such as facebook and myspace has also provided new ways for users from junior high school age on up to create and share content
0,the marketplace has spoken and the desktop gui is now the mainstream interface for most ordinary pc users
0,however there are a variety of other interfaces that are used for particular circumstances or applications such as touchscreens as with atms handwriting or written gesture recognition such as on handheld computers or for drawing tablets voice controlled systems trackballs joysticks and touchpads used as mouse alternatives virtual reality interfaces using head mounted systems sensor gloves and so on because much interaction with computers is now away from the desktop and taking place on laptops handheld or palm computers and even in cars there is likely to be continuing experimentation with user interface design
0,dating back to the mid 1990s vbscript is a scripting language developed by microsoft and based on its popular visual basic programming language
0,it is also part of the evolution of what microsoft called active scripting based on components that allow outside access to the capabilities of applications
0,the host environment in which scripts run is provided through windows as with windows script host or within microsoft s internet explorer browser
0,for client side processing vbscript can be used to write scripts embedded in html pages which interact with the standard document object model in a way similar to other web scripting languages in particular see javascript
0,however vbscript is not supported by popular non microsoft browsers such as firefox and opera so developers generally must use the widely compatible javascript instead
0,vbscript can also be used for processing on the web server particularly in connection with microsoft s web servers
0,because versions of windows starting with windows 98 include windows script host vbscripts can also be written to run directly under windows
0,one unfortunate consequence was scripts containing worms such as the i love you worm or other malware and mailed as attachments to unwary use
0,when videotape first became available in the 1950s recorders cost thousands of dollars and could only be afforded by tv studios
0,today the vcr is inexpensive and ubiquitous
0,however it is hard to edit videotape
0,tape is a linear medium meaning that to find a given piece of video the tape has to be moved to that spot
0,removing or adding something involves either physically splicing the tape as is done with film or more commonly feeding in tape from two or more recorders onto a destination tape
0,besides being tedious and limited in capabilities linear editing by copying loses a bit of quality with each copying operation
0,today however it is easy to shoot video in digital form or to convert analog video into digital form
0,digital video is a stream of data that represents sampling of the source signal such as from the chargecoupled device ccd that turns light photons into electron flow in a digital camera or digital camcorder
0,this process involves either software or hardware compression for storage and decompression for viewing and editing such a scheme is called a codec for compression decompression
0,the most widely used formats include dv digital video and mpeg motion picture expert group which has versions that vary in the amount of compression and thus fidelity
0,a little later bulletin boards and especially systems such as the well whole earth lectronic link based in the san francisco bay area provided long term outlets for people to share information and interact on line
0,looking at the well a writer named howard rheingold introduced the term virtual community in a 1993 book
0,he explored the ways in which a sufficiently compelling and versatile technology encouraged people to form long term contacts form personal relationships and carry out feuds
0,when on line participants experience such a venue as the well as a place that becomes almost as tangible and often as real as a physical place such as a small town or corner bar
0,virtual community members who live in the same geographical area sometimes do get together physically the well has had picniclike well office parties for many years
0,members can band together to support a colleague who faces a crisis such as the life threatening illness of a son on the well blank postings called beams are often used as an expression of sympathy
0,the virtual community can also serve as a rallying point following a physical disaster such as the 1989 earthquake in the san francisco bay area
0,on a daily basis virtual communities can often provide help or advice from a remarkable variety of highly qualified experts
0,the computing field virtualization involves the creation of a working model or representation of one system within a different system
0,this idea has been widely used in the field since the 1960s
0,some applications of virtualization include an appropriate model of a system such as a programming framework see application programming interface that hides unneeded details can make it easier for programmers to understand and access its functions
0,a compiler for a language that compiles all programs to an intermediate representation such as bytecode
0,a virtual machine running on each kind of platform can then run the code taking care of the details required by the host hardware
0,a virtual machine created in software can be designed to perform all the functions available on a particular hardware platform or operating system allowing software to be run on a system different from the one for which it was originally written
0,for example there are a number of virtualization programs such as vmware for pcs that can create separate areas in memory each running a different operating system such as a version of windows or linux
0,
0,multiple processors or entire computers can be treated as a single entity for processing a program with software designed to assign threads of execution to physical processors and to coordinate the use of shared data
0,a physical device such as a disk drive can be made to appear as several separate devices to the operating system for better organization of data
0,similarly many servers can run on the same physical machine
0,conversely multiple drives can appear to be a single logical device while providing redundancy and error recovery
0,a secure virtual private network can be created within the larger public internet
0,the virtual system takes care of encrypting and transmitting data through the physical network
0,the concept of virtualization can also be applied to how work involving computers is being conceptualized and organized in the modern world
0,a virtual office or even virtual corporation is a business entity that is not tied to a physical location but uses networks communications technology and facilities such as video conferencing to keep workers in touch
0,alternatively several organizations can share the same physical space such as for mail or shipping while maintaining their separate identities
0,similarly people can form long lasting social networks while meeting physically seldom if at all see socialnetworking and virtual community
0,besides military training currently the most viable application for vr seems to be entertainment
0,vr techniques have been used to create immersive experiences in elaborate facilities at venues such as disneyland and universal studios and to some extent even in local arcades
0,vr that is accompanied by convincing physical sensations has allowed for the creation of a new generation of roller coasters that if built physically would be too expensive too dangerous or even physically impossible
0,however there are other significant emerging applications for vr
0,when combined with telerobotic technology vr techniques are already being used to allow surgeons to perform operations in new ways
0,vr technology can also be used to make remote conferencing more realistic and satisfactory for participants
0,clearly the potential uses for vr for education and training in many different fields are endless
0,vr technology combined with robotics could also be used to give disabled persons much greater ability to carry out the tasks of daily life
0,in the ultimate vr system users will be networked and able to simultaneously experience the environment interacting both with it and one another
0,the technical resources and programming challenges are also much greater for such applications
0,the result however might well be the sort of environment depicted by science fiction writers such as william gibson
0,the basic idea of voip is simple the internet can carry packets of any sort of data which means it can carry the digitized human voice as well carrying ordinary phone calls
0,there are several ways to do this a regular phone plus an adapter that connects to the computer and compresses and converts between regular analog phone signals and the digital equivalent a complete ip phone unit that includes all needed hardware and software no computer needed just a network connection such as to a router use of the computer s own sound card and speakers with a microphone plus software often free using that last option voip service can be essentially free regardless of distance
0,however one can only call someone who is currently connected to the internet and also has voip software
0,at least as currently implemented voip does have some disadvantages like cordless phones but unlike traditional phones voip requires that the user be connected to power
0,this may make the system unavailable in an emergency
0,also in an emergency a 911 operator has no way to know where the caller is located geographically
0,this could be a problem if the caller is unable to provide this information
0,while a regular phone is a pretty simple device voip requires special hardware or a pc which might fail
0,voip requires a working internet connection in practice a high speed connection
0,load or instability in the network could cause interruptions in calls or a lowering of voice quality
0,as with other data sent over the internet there are potential security concerns
0,encryption can be used to secure voip calls but this in turn leads to concerns by law enforcement agencies seeking to implement eavesdropping warrants
0,for some time technology pundits have talked about computers being literally woven into daily life embedded in clothing and personal accessories
0,however implementations have thus far seen only limited use
0,for example watches with limited computer functions have not proven popular a watch large enough for input and display of information would likely be too bulky for comfort
0,people have also walked about with attached webcams although the novelty seems to have quickly worn off
0,although the most important part of web 2
0,0 is its business and social models a number of web technologies are needed to provide the flexibility and rich interaction needed to offer a new web experience
0,these include dynamic efficient generation of content programming interfaces using structured text files platforms for running applications in the browser such as google apps merging and customizing content from different sources user subscription to content platforms for user created content and collaboration
0,some typical features of a modern web browser include navigation buttons to move forward and back through recently visited pages tabs to switch between web pages a history panel allowing return to pages visited in recent days a search button that brings up the default search engine which can be chosen by the user the ability to save page as favorites or bookmarks for easy retrieval
0,today a web user can view a live news broadcast listen to music from a radio station or view a document formatted to near print quality
0,all these activities are made possible by helper software that gives the web browser the capability to load and display or play files in special formats
0,examples include the adobe pdf portable document format reader the windows media player and realplayer for playing video and audio content
0,what makes the browser even more versatile is the ability to load and run programs from web sites
0,java was highly touted starting in the mid 1990s and some observers believed that by making web browsers into platforms capable of running any sort of software there would be less need for proprietary operating systems such as microsoft windows
0,thousands of real time views of the world are available on the web
0,these include everything from the prosaic a coffee machine at mit to the international a view of downtown paris or tokyo to the sublime a rocky mountain sunset
0,all of these views are made possible thanks to the availability of inexpensive digital cameras
0,to create a basic webcam the user connects a digital camera to a pc usually via a usb cable
0,a program controls the camera taking a picture at frequent intervals perhaps every 30 seconds or minute
0,the picture is received from the camera as a jpg jpeg file
0,the program then uploads the picture to the user s web page usually using file transfer protocol or ftp replacing the previous picture
0,users connected to the web site can click to see the latest picture
0,alternatively a script running on the server can update the picture automatically
0,the web filter examines requests made by a web user and blocks those associated with sites deemed by the filter user to be objectionable
0,there are two basic mechanisms for determining whether a site is unsuitable
0,the first is to check the site s address url against a list and reject a request for any site on the list
0,most filter programs come with default lists the filter user can add other sites as desired
0,generally the filter is installed with a password so only the authorized user such as a parent can change the filter s behavior
0,the other filtering method relies on a list of keywords associated with objectionable activities such as pornography
0,when the user requests a site the filter checks the page for words on the keyword list
0,if a matching word or phrase is found the site is blocked and not shown to the user
0,there are many online services including some free ones that will provide users with personal web pages
0,there are also programs such as microsoft frontpage that allow users to design web pages by arranging objects visually on the screen and setting their properties
0,however creating and maintaining a complete web site with its many linked pages interactive forms and interfaces to databases and other services is a complicated affair
0,for most moderate to large size organizations it requires the services of a new category of it professional the webmaster
0,understanding how the web site responds to and manages requests fluency in the basic formatting of text and other page content and the use of frames and other tools for organizing and presenting text extended formatting and content organization facilities such as cascading style sheets css dynamic html dhtml and extensible markup language use of graphics formats and graphics and animation programs such as photoshop flash and dreamweaver extending the interactivity of web pages through writing scripts using tools such as javascript and php dealing with platform and compatibility issues including browser compatibility
0,when a user types in or clicks on a link in the browser window the browser sends a http request
0,to construct the request the browser first looks at the address url in the user request
0,an address such as
0,well
0,com conferencing
0,html consists of three parts in order to direct the browser s request to the appropriate host and server the browser sends the url to a name server
0,the name server provides the appropriate numeric ip address
0,the browser then sends an http get request to the server s ip address
0,assuming the page requested is valid the server sends the html file to the browser
0,the browser in turn interprets the formatting and display instructions in the html file and renders the text and graphics appropriately
0,it is remarkable that this whole process from user click to displayed page usually takes only a few seconds even if the web site is thousands of miles away and requests must be relayed through many intervening computers
0,there are several ways in which web services can be accessed remote procedure call rpc which generally uses wsdl and follows a format similar to the traditional way programs call upon library functions an organization based on the available messages rather than calls or operations representational state transfer rest which views applications or services as collections of resources with specific addresses urls and specific requests using variety of other specifications and approaches can be used this area is a very fluid one
0,fortunately programmers and even users can build new web applications without having to know the details of how the underlying services work
0,wiki software varies in details such as use of markup languages programming interface and platform
0,however most wikis include the following features users can create new pages articles or edit existing ones
0,pages contain links to related pages sometimes using wiki words where wordsarescrunchedtogetherwithintialcaps
0,simple markup can be used to create such effects as boldface headings or lists
0,the wiki software usually translates this to html for rendering
0,a record is kept of each contribution or edit often displayed on a recent changes page
0,
0,many wikis use a database such as mysql to store and retrieve pages
0,some wikis simply store each page as a file and a few such as tiddlywiki store all pages together as a single document
0,wikis can be public open to anyone or restricted such as to members of an organization
0,the administrator of the wiki establishes guidelines or standards such as for citing sources for facts and procedures for dealing with disputes and controversial topics
0,typically a wireless lan uses a frequency band with each unit on a slightly different frequency thus allowing all units to communicate without interference
0,although radio frequency is now most popular wireless lans can also use microwave links which are sometimes used as an alternative to ethernet cable in large facilities
0,usually there is a network access point a pc that contains a transceiver and serves as the network hub it may also serve as a bridge between the wireless network and a wired lan
0,the hub computer can also be connected to a high speed internet service via dsl or cable
0,it has an antenna allowing it to communicate with wireless pcs up to several hundred feet away depending on building configuration
0,each computer on the wireless network has an adapter with a transceiver so it can communicate with the access point
0,the adapter can be built in as is the case with some handheld computers or mounted on a pc card for laptops or an isa card for desktop pcs or connected to a usb port
0,the term word processor was actually coined by ibmin the 1960s to refer to a system consisting of a selectric typewriter with magnetic tape storage
0,this allowed the typist to record keystrokes and some data such as margin settings on tape
0,material could be corrected by being rerecorded
0,the tape could then be used to print as many perfect copies of the document as required
0,a version using magnetic cards instead of tape appeared in 1969
0,the first modern style word processor was marketed by lexitron and linolex
0,it also used magnetic tape but it added a video display screen
0,now the writer could see and correct text without having to print it first
0,a few years later a new invention the floppy disk became the standard storage medium for dedicated word processing systems
0,the word processing systems developed by wang digital equipment corporation data general and others became a feature in large offices in the late 1970s
0,these systems were essentially minicomputers with screens keyboards and printers and running a specialized software program
0,because these systems were expensive ranging from about 8 000 to 20 000 or more they were not affordable by smaller businesses
0,typically they were operated by specially trained personnel who became known also as word processors to whom documents were funneled for processing as with the old typing poo
0,some typical features today include different views of the document including an outline showing headings down to a user specified level automatic table of contents and index generation tables and multicolumn text automatic formatting of bulleted and numbered lists built in and user defined styles for headings paragraphs and so on
0,the ability to use built in or user defined templates to provide starting settings for new documents the ability to record or otherwise specify a series of commands to be performed automatically spelling and grammar checkers the ability to incorporate a variety of graphics image formats in the document automatic formatting and linking of web hyperlinks within documents the ability to import and export documents in a variety of formats including web documents
0,zuse was born on june 22 1910 in berlin
0,he stud ied civil engineering at the technische hochschule berlin charlottenburg receiving his degree in 1935
0,one of histasks in engineering was performing calculations of thestress on structures such as bridges
0,at the time these cal culations were carried out by going through a series of stepson a form over and over again plugging in the data andcalculating by hand or using an electromechanical calcula tor
0,like other inventors before him zuse began to wonderwhether he could build a machine that could carry outthese repetitive steps automatically
0,departing from other calculator designers
0,the z1 had trouble storing and retrieving numbers andnever worked well
0,undeterred zuse began to develop anew machine that used electromechanical telephone relays a ubiquitous component that was also favored by howardaiken see aiken howard
0,the new machine workedmuch better and zuse successfully demonstrated it at thegerman aerodynamics research institute in 1939
0,with world war ii under way zuse was able to obtainfunding for his z3 which was able to carry out automaticsequences from instructions
0,zuseused spare time from his military duties at the henschelaircraft company to work on the z4 which was completedin 1949
0,since the late 1990s web users particularly younger ones have been adept at sharing media content online
0,in the 2000 decade however the emphasis has shifted to users not merely sharing otherpeoples content but creating their own
0,the first part of the recipe was the availability ofubiquitous digital cameras and camcorders the second partwas easy to use video editing software and the third partwas a web site that could host the results
0,created in 2005 by three former paypal employees thevideo sharing site youtube has been the leading venue foramateur video
0,although available content includes clipsfrom movies and tv shows some unauthorized much ofthe most interesting content is original videos created anduploaded by users
0,beyond just sharing or accessing con tent users are encouraged to rate and comment on the vid eos they see and users can also subscribe to feeds of newmaterial that is likely to be of interest to them
0,by 2008 more than 83 million videos were available onyoutube and hundreds of thousands added each day
0,youtube broke into the highly visual field ofpolitical advertising
0,most candidates in the 2008 presiden tial primaries have put their statements and other videos onyoutube
0,ups
0,political commentators and journalists have also beenactive in putting their opinions on youtube or comment ing on those of others
0,perhaps the political establishment sbiggest nod to youtube is the series of debates cosponsoredby cnn and youtube bringing together the republicanand democratic primary fields
0,youtube has had its share of criticism critics havecharged the service with not sufficiently policing copyrightviolations and violent content including videos of fightsor bullying in schools as well as neo nazi propaganda scenes of animal abuse and videos by anti american insur gent groups as well as generally tasteless exhibitionism
0,afew countries and some schools have responded by block ing access to the service
0,yahoo has played an importantrole in the development of web services
0,in 1994 stan ford students jerry yang and david filo developed the firstpopular directory of web sites
0,realizing thatthe millions of web users flocking to their site provided anopportunity for advertising and services the two partnersincorporated yahoo
0,in 1995
0,yahoo
0,continued to grow and the company acquireda number of other online services which they used to pro vide web based e mail web hosting and news
0,but havingflown so high yahoo
0,had far to fall when the dot com mar ket bubble burst in 2001 a stock that had traded at around 130
0,00 per share fell as low as 4
0,06
0,however yahoo
0,proved its resilience as one of the fewearly dot coms to survive and has continued to thrive inthe post bubble era since 2002
0,the company made strate gic partnerships with telecommunications companies suchas bt and verizon
0,yahoo
0,entered a continuing strugglewith another web services powerhouse whileacquiring new media sites such as the photo sharing ser vice flickr and the social bookmarking service del

0,yahoo
0,also provides onlinestorefronts competing in that venue mainly with ebay
0,computers and technology play a role in the lives of mostyoung people that many adults have difficulty compre hending
0,children in industrialized countries are liable toencounter video games even before they arrive at school
0,once there they will be exposed to a considerable amountof educational software depending on their school s afflu ence
0,upon returningfrom school there are more sophisticated games myspacepages to keep updated sophisti cated tools for creating music and video and of course theinternet in all its vast diversity
0,meanwhile a web of inces sant messages islikely to keep the youngster in touch with friends
0,in recent years there has been growing concern that internet users may eventually be treated differently by service pro viders depending on the kind of data they download or the kind of application programs they use online
0,advocates of network or net neutrality want legislation that would bar cable dsl or other provid ers from making such distinctions such as by charging content pro viders higher fees for high volumes of data or even blocking certain applications
0,advocates of net neutrality believe that since there are rather limited choices for broadband internet service discrimination on the basis of web content could lead to a loss of freedom for consumers and providers alike
0,nlp is a multidisciplinary field that draws from linguis tics and computer science particularly artificial intelligence
0,in terms of linguistics a program must be able to deal with words that have multiple mean ings wind up the clock and the wind is cold today as well as grammatical ambiguities in the phrase little girl s school is it the school that is little the girls or both
0,of course each language has its own forms of ambiguity
0,programs can use several strategies for dealing with these problems including using statistical models to predict the likely meaning of a given phrase based on a corpus of existing text in that language
0,as formidable as the task of extracting the correct lit eral meaning from text can be it is really only the first level of natural language processing
0,if a program is to success fully summarize or draw conclusions about a news report from north korea for example it would also have to have a knowledge base of facts about that country and or a set of frames about how to interpret vari ous situations such as threat bluff or compromise
0,users of modern operating systems such as microsoft win dows are familiar with multitasking or running several programs at the same time
0,for example a user might be writing a document in a word processor pause to check the e mail program for incoming messages type a page address int o a web browser then return to writing
0,meanwhile the operating system may be running a number of other pro grams tucked unobtrusively into the background such as a virus checker task scheduler or system resource monitor
0,each running program takes turns using the pc s cen tral processor
0,in early versions of windows multitasking was cooperative with each program expected to periodically yield the processor to windows so it could be assigned to the next program in the queue
0,one weakness of this approach is that if a program crashes the cpu might be locked up and the system would have to be rebooted
0,however win dows nt 2000 and xp as well as operating systems such as unix use preemptive multitasking
0,the operating sys tem assigns a slice of processing cpu time to a program and then switches it to the next program regardless of what might be happening to the previous program
0,thus if a pro gram crashes the cpu will still be switched to the next program and the user can maintain control of the system and shut down the offending program
0,microsoft
0,net is a programming platform that is intended to pro vide a clear and consistent way for applications written in a variety of languages such as c c and visual basic to access windows functions and to interact with other programs and services on the same machine or over the internet net consists of the following main parts base class library of data types and common func tions such as file manipulation and graphics that is available to all
0,net languages common language runtime which provides the code that applications need to run within the operat ing system manage memory and so forth common language means it can be used for any
0,net pro gramming language
0,asp
0,net a class framework for building dynamic web applications and services the latest version of asp see activeserverpages ado
0,net a class framework that allows programs to access databases and data services
0,whatever memory chips or other devices are installed in a computer the operating system and application programs must have a way to allocate use and eventually release portions of memory
0,the goal of memory management is to use available memory most efficiently
0,this can be difficult in modern operating environments where dozens of pro grams may be competing for memory resources
0,early computers were generally able to run only one program at a time
0,these machines didn t have a true oper ating system just a small loader program that loaded the application program which essentially took over control of the machine and accessed and manipulated the memory
0,later systems offered the ability to break main memory into several fixed partitions
0,while this allowed more than one program to run at the same time it wasn t very flexible
0,if computers were merely fast sequential calculators they would still be of some use
0,however much of the power of the computer comes from its ability to carry out repetitive tasks without supervision
0,the loop is the programming language structure that controls such activities
0,virtually every language has some form of loop construct with vari ations in syntax ranging from the relatively english like cobol and pascal to the more cryptic c
0,starting in the 1980s many organizations sought to connect their employees desktop computers so they could share central databases share or back up files communicate via e mail and collaborate on projects
0,a system that links computers within a single office or home or a larger area such as a building or campus is called a local area network lan
0,larger networks linking branches of an organiza tion throughout the country or world are called wide area networks or wans
0,see network
0,naturally there must be software to manage the transmis sion and reception of data packets
0,the structure of a packet sometimes called a frame has been standardized with a preamble source and destination addresses the data itself a checksum and two special layers that interface with the differing ways that ethernet and token ring networks physi cally handle the packets
0,a list is a series of data items that can be accessed sequen tially by following links from one item to the next
0,lists can be very useful for ordering or sorting data items and for storing them on a stack or queue
0,there are two general approaches to constructing lists
0,in a data list used with procedural programming languages such as c each list item consists of a structure consisting of a data member and a pointer
0,the pointer called next contains the address of the next item
0,a program can easily step through a list by starting with the first item process ing its data then using the pointer to move to the next item continuing until some condition is met or the end of the list is reached
0,lists are generally used to provide convenient access to rel atively small amounts of data where flexibility is required
0,unlike an array a list need use only as much memory as it needs to accommodate the current number of items includ ing their associated pointers
0,a lisp style node list can be even more flexible in that items with varying sizes and types of data can be included in the same list
0,lists are thus a more flexible way to implement such things as look up tables
0,linux is an increasingly popular alternative to proprietary operating systems
0,its development sprang from two sources
0,first was the creation of open source versions of unix utili ties by maverick programmer richard stallman as part of the gnu gnu s not unix project during the 1980s
0,although these tools were useful the kernel or basic set of operating system functions was still missing
0,starting in 1991 another creative programmer linus torvalds began to release open source versions of the unix kernel
0,the combination of the ker nel and utilities became known as linux a combination of linus and unix though stallman and his supporters believe that gnu linux is a more accurate name
0,the idea behind an operating system kernel is that there is a relatively small core set of primitive functions that are necessary for the operation of system services
0,these functions can be provided in a single component that can be adapted and updated as desir able
0,the fundamental services include process control scheduling how the processes pro grams or threads of execution within programs share the cpu switching execution between processes cre ating new processes and terminating existing ones
0,interprocess communication sending messages between processes enabling them to share data or coordinate their data processing
0,memory management allocating and freeing up memory as requested by processes as well as imple menting virtual memory where physical storage is treated as an extension of main ram memory
0,see memorymanagement
0,file system services creating opening reading from writing to closing and deleting files
0,javascript is one of several popular languages that can enable web pages to interact with users more quickly and efficiently
0,the language first appeared in the mid 1990s netscape 2 browser under the name livescript
0,technically javascript is the sun microsystems trademark for its implementation of a standard called ecmascript
0,despite the name java script is not directly related to the java programming lan guage
0,in its early years javascript was perhaps a victim of its own success
0,having a relatively easy to use scripting lan guage provided an easier way to add features such as 3d buttons and pop up windows to formerly humdrum web forms
0,however as with an earlier generation s fondness for multiple fonts early javascript programmers were often prone to add unnecessary and confusing clutter to web pages
0,besides sometimes annoying users early javascript also suffered from significant differences in how it was implemented by the major browsers
0,as a result netscape users were sometimes stymied by javascript written for micr osoft internet explorer and vice versa
0,finally browser flaws have sometimes allowed javascript to be used to com promise security such as by installing malware infested browser helpers
0,as a result many security experts began to recommend that users disable javascript execution in their browsers
0,java has largely fulfilled this promise for web developers
0,c programmers have an easy learning curve to java since the two languages have very similar syntax and a similar use of classes and other object oriented features
0,on the other hand programmers who don t know c benefit from java being more streamlined than c
0,for example java avoids the necessity to use pointers and uses classes as the consistent building block of program structure
0,software powerhouses such as microsoft until recently and ibm have joined sun in pro moting java
0,another much touted feature of java is its platform independence
0,the language itself is separate from the vari ous operating system platforms
0,for each platform a java vir tual machine jvm is created which interprets or com piles the code generated by the java compiler so it can run on that platform
0,for security java applets run within a sandbox or restricted environment so the user is protected from mali cious java programs
0,for example programs are not allowed to access the user s disk or to connect the user s machine to another web site
0,web browsers can also be set to disable the running of java applets
0,java is a computer language similar in structure to c
0,although java is a general purpose programming language it is most often used for creating applications to run on the internet such as web servers
0,a special type of java pro gram called an applet can be linked into web pages and run on the user s web browser
0,as an object oriented language java uses classes that provide commonly needed functions including the creation of user interface objects such as windows and buttons
0,a variety of sets of classes class frameworks are available such as the awt abstract windowing toolkit
0,an interpreter is a program that analyzes parses program ming commands or statements in a high level language creates equivalent executable instructions in machine code and executes them
0,an interpreter differs from a compiler in that the lat ter converts the entire program to an executable file rather than processing and executing it a statement at a time
0,many earlier versions of the basic programming lan guage were implemented as interpreters
0,since an inter preter only has to hold one program statement at a time in memory it could run on early microcomputers that had only a few tens of thousands of bytes of system memory
0,how ever interpreters run programs considerably more slowly than a compiled program would run
0,one reason is that an interpreter throws away each source code statement after it interprets it
0,this means that if a statement runs repeat edly it must be re interpreted each time it runs
0,a compiler on the other hand would create only one set of machine code instructions for the loop and then move on
0,also because a compiler keeps the entire program in memory it can analyze the relationship between multiple statements and recognize ways to rearrange or substitute them for greater efficiency
0,an internet service provider is any organization that pro vides access to the internet
0,while nonprofit organiza tions such as universities and government agencies can be internet service provider considered to be isps the term is generally applied to a commercial fee based service
0,typically a user is given an account that is accessed by logging in through the operating system s internet connec tion facility by supplying a user id and password
0,once con nected the user can run web browsers e mail clients and other programs that are designed to work with an internet connection
0,most isps now charge flat monthly fees rang ing from 20 or so for dial up access to around 40 60 for high speed cable or dsl connections
0,some services such as america online and compuserve include isp service as part of a package that also includes such features as software libraries discussion forums and instant messaging
0,online services tend to be more expen sive than no frills isp services
0,internet radio is the provision of radio broadcast content over the internet
0,basically the digitized sound files of the broadcasts can be accessed and played using widely available software such as windows media player or realplayer
0,internet radio began in the mid 1990s and today an increasing number of broadcast stations are offering their programming in this form allowing them to reach audiences far beyond the reach of their signal
0,some stations stream live during the actual broadcast while others make programs available for download
0,for auto matic downloading of broadcasts see podcasting
0,there are also radio stations that provide their content only via the internet
0,internet radio should not be confused with satellite or cable radio which carry conventional radio sig nals in real time
0,the growth of the internet and its centrality in business education and other fields has led many programmers to specialize in internet related applications
0,these can include the following low level infrastructure networking wired and wire less routing encryption support and so on web servers and related software e commerce infrastructure interfacing with databases data analysis and extraction support for searching autonomous software to navigate the net internet based communications systems to deliver text and media support for collaborative use of the internet security software firewalls intrusion analysis etc
0,netnews also called usenet for unix user net work is in effect the world s largest computer bul letin board
0,it began in 1979 when duke university and the university of north carolina set up a simple mechanism for posting text files that could be read by other users
0,today there are tens of thousands of topical newsgroups and millions of messages called articles
0,although still impressive in its quantity of content many web users now rely more on discus sion forums based on web pages
0,ftp file transport protocol enables the transfer of one or more files between any two machines con nected to the internet
0,this method of file transfer has been largely supplanted by the use of download links on web pages except for high volume applica tions where an ftp server is often operated behind the scenes of a web link
0,ftp is also used by web developers to upload file
0,telnet is another fundamental service that brought the internet much of its early utility
0,telnet allows a user at one computer to log into another machine and run a program there
0,this provided an early means for users at pcs or workstations to for example access the library of congress catalog online
0,however if program and file permissions are not set properly on the host system telnet can cause security vulner abilities
0,the telnet user is also vulnerable to having ids and passwords stolen since these are transmitted as clear unencrypted text
0,as a result some online sites that once supported telnet access now limit access to web based forms
0,another alternative is to use a program called secure shell or ssh or to use a telnet client that supports encryption
0,wais wide area information service is a gateway that allows databases to be searched over the inter net
0,wais provided a relatively easy way to bring large data resources online
0,it too has largely been replaced by web based database services
0,the internet is the worldwide network of all computers or networks of computers that communicate using a particu lar protocol for routing data from one computer to another
0,as long as the programs they run follow the rules of the protocol the computers can be connected by a variety of physical means including ordinary and special phone lines cable fiber optics and even wireless or satel lite transmission
0,internationalization and localization are ways to adapt computer software often created in the united states or europe to other languages and cultures
0,the abbreviations i18n and l10n are sometimes used for internationalization and localization respectively the numbers in each word refer to the number of letters in the alphabet between the letters
0,the two processes are complementary
0,by the mid 2000 decade the biggest intellectual property battles were not about esoteric program codes but rather revolved around how to satisfy the ordinary home consum er s appetite for music and video while preserving produc ers revenues
0,increasingly music and even video is being downloaded rather than being bought in commercial pack aging at the local store
0,in the sony v universal case 1984 the supreme court ruled that manufacturers of devices such as vcrs were not liable for their misuse if there were substantial non infringing uses such as someone making a copy of legally possessed media for their own use
0,however in 2005 the supreme court ruled that grokster a decentralized file sharing service could be held liable for the distribution of illegally copied media if it actively induced such copying
0,by 2006 media industry lobbyists particularly the recording industry institute of america or riaa were promoting a number of bills in congress that would fur ther restrict consumers rights to use media
0,such mea sures might include requiring that devices be able to detect flagged media and refuse to copy it as well as adding stricter provisions to the digital millennium copyright act dmca
0,these mea sures are opposed by cyber libertarian groups such as the electronic frontier foundation and consumer groups such as the home recording rights coalition
0,intellectual property can be defined as the rights the cre ator of an original work such as an invention or a book has to control its reproduction or use
0,developers of new computer hardware software and media content must be able to realize a return on their time and effort
0,this return is threatened by the ease with which programs and data on disks can be illicitly copied and redistributed
0,several legal mechanisms can be used to deter such behavior
0,information theory is the study of the fundamental charac teristics of information and its transmission and reception
0,as a discipline information theory took its impetus from the ideas of claude shannon
0,in his seminal paper a mathematical theory of com munication published in the bell system technical journalin 1948 shannon analyzed the redundancy inherent in any form of communication other than a series of purely ran dom numbers
0,because of this redundancy the amount of information expressed in binary bits needed to convey a message will be less than the number in the original mes sage
0,it is because of redundancy that data compression algorithms can be applied to text graphics and other types of files to be stored on disk or transmitted over a network
0,while much attention is paid by system designers to the representation storage and manipulation of information in the computer the ultimate value of information processing software is determined by how well it provides for the effec tive retrieval of that information
0,the quality of retrieval is dependent on several factors hardware data organization search algorithms and user interface
0,image processing is a general term for the manipulation of a digitized image to produce an enhanced or more con venient version
0,some of the earliest applications were in the military aerial and later satellite reconnaissance and in the space program
0,the military and space programs had a great need for extracting as much useful information as possible from images that were often gathered under extreme or marginal conditions
0,they also needed to make cameras and other hardware components simultaneously more compact and more efficient and generally had the funds to pay for such specialized developments
0,once developed higher quality image processing sys tems found their way into other applications such as domes tic surveillance and medical imaging
0,the development of cameras that could directly turn light into digitized images made image processing seam less by avoiding the necessity of scanning images from tra ditional film
0,image processing applications can be divided into three general categories enhancement interpretation and maintenance
0,starting in the late 1950s in computer facilities at mit stanford and other research universities people began to encounter persons who had both unusual programming skill and an obsession with the inner workings of the machine
0,while ordinary users viewed the computer sim ply as a tool for solving particular problems this peculiar breed of programmers reveled in extending the capabilities of the system and creating tools such as program editors that would make it easier to create even more powerful programs
0,the movement from mainframes that could run only one program at a time to machines that could simulta neously serve many users created a kind of environmental niche in which these self described hackers could flourish
0,indeed while administrators sometimes complained that hackers took up too much of the available computer time they often depended on them to fix the bugs that infested the first versions of time sharing operating systems
0,hack ers also tended to work in the wee hours of the night while normal users slept
0,the base 16 or hexadecimal system is a natural way to rep resent the binary data stored in a computer
0,it is more com pact than binary because four binary digits can be replaced by a single hex digit
0,the following table gives the corresponding decimal binary and hex values from 0 to 15 note that decimal and hex digits are the same from 0 to 9 but hex uses the letters a f to represent the digits cor responding to decimal 10 15
0,the system extends to higher numbers using increasing powers of 16 just as decimal uses powers of 10 for example hex ff represents binary 111 11111 or decimal 255 many of the apparently arbitrary numbers encountered in programming can be better under stood if one realizes that they correspond to convenient groupings of bits ff is eight bits sufficient to hold a single character
0,in low level pro gramming memory addresses are also usually given in hex
0,in operating systems and certain programming languages such as lisp a heap is a pool of memory resources avail able for allocation by programs
0,the memory segments sometimes called cells can be the same size or of variable size
0,if the same size they are linked together by pointers
0,memory is then allocated for a vari able by traversing the list and setting the required number of cells to be owned by that variable
0,while some lan guages such as pascal and c use explicit memory allocation or deallocation functions other languages such as lisp use a separate runtime module that is not the responsibility of the programmer
0,in the early days of computing the programmers of a sys tem tended to also be its users and were thus intimately familiar with the program s operation and command set
0,to search a hashed database the hashing formula is first applied to the search key yielding a hash value
0,that value can then be used in a binary search to quickly zero in on the matching record if any
0,health personalif not a programmer the user of a mainframe program was probably at least a well trained operator who could work with the aid of a brief summary or notes provided by the programmer
0,however with the beginnings of office auto mation in the 1970s and the growing use of desktop com puters in office home and school in the 1980s increasingly complex programs were being put in the hands of users who often had only minimal computer training
0,while programs often came with one or more tutorial or reference manuals designers realized that offering help through the program itself would have some clear advan tages
0,first the user would not have to switch attention from the computer screen to look things up in a manual
0,second the help system could be programmed to not only provide information but also to help the user find the informa tion needed in a given situation
0,for example related topics could be linked together and a searchable index provided
0,a hash is a numeric value generated by applying a math ematical formula to the numeric values of the characters in a string of text
0,the for mula is chosen so that the values it produces are always the same length regardless of the length of the original text and are very likely to be unique
0,two different strings should not produce the same hash value
0,such an event is called a collision
0,the two major application areas for hashing are informa tion retrieval and cryptographic certification
0,in databases an index table can be built that contains the hash values for the key fields and the corresponding record number for each field with the entries in hash value order
0,to search the database an input key is hashed and the value is compared with the index table which can be done using a very fast binary search
0,if the hash value is found the corresponding record number is used to look up the record
0,this tends to be much faster than searching an index file directly
0,even after decades of evolution in computing the hard disk drive remains the primary means of fast data storage and retrieval in computer systems of all sizes
0,the disk itself consists of a rigid aluminum alloy platter coated with a magnetic oxide material
0,the platter can be rotated at speeds of more than 10 000 rpm
0,a typical drive consists of a stack of such platters mounted on a rotating spindle with a read write head mounted above each platter
0,early hard drive heads were controlled by a stepper motor which positioned the head in response to a series of electrical pulses
0,this system is still used for floppy drives
0,today s hard drives however are controlled by a voice coil actuator similar in structure to an audio speaker
0,the coil surrounds a magnet
0,when a current enters the coil it gen erates a magnetic field that interacts with that of the perma nent magnet moving the coil and thus the disk head
0,unlike the stepper motor the voice coil is continuously variable and its greater precision allows data tracks to be packed more tightly on the platter surface increasing disk capacity
0,the storage capacity of a drive is determined by the number of platters and the spacing and thus number of tracks that can be laid down on each platter
0,capacities have steadily increased while prices have plummeted in 1980 for example a hard drive for an apple ii microcom put er cost more than 1 000 and held only 5 mb of data
0,as of 2007 internal hard drives with a capacity of 500 gb or more cost around a 150

0,most interfaces between users and computer systems involve the equivalent of switches keyboard keys or mouse but tons
0,these interfaces cannot respond to degrees of pres sure for an exception see graphicstablet
0,further there is no feedback returned to the user through the interface device the key or mouse does not push back
0,haptic from the greek word for touch interfaces are different in that they do register the pressure and motion of touch and they often provide touch feedback as well
0,some emerging or near future uses of haptic technology include one approach to handwriting recognition involves the extraction of a stroke pattern and its comparison to a database of templates rep resenting various letters and symbols
0,ultimately the corresponding ascii character is determined and stored
0,haptic interfaces remote surgery where the surgeon can feel the resis tance of tissues and the location of anatomical features use of haptic technology to provide robots with more humanlike gripping capabilities 3d sculpture in a virtual 3d world modeling the char acteristics of different materials and tools
0,starting in the late 1950s in computer facilities at mit stanford and other research universities people began to encounter persons who had both unusual programming skill and an obsession with the inner workings of the machine
0,while ordinary users viewed the computer sim ply as a tool for solving particular problems this peculiar breed of programmers reveled in extending the capabilities of the system and creating tools such as program editors that would make it easier to create even more powerful programs
0,the movement from mainframes that could run only one program at a time to machines that could simulta neously serve many users created a kind of environmental niche in which these self described hackers could flourish
0,indeed while administrators sometimes complained that hackers took up too much of the available computer time they often depended on them to fix the bugs that infested the first versions of time sharing operating systems
0,hack ers also tended to work in the wee hours of the night while normal users slept
0,a handwriting recognition system begins by building a representation of the user s writing
0,with a pen or stylus system this representation is not simply a graphical image but includes the recorded strokes or discrete movements that make up the letters
0,the software must then create a representation of features of the handwriting that can be used to match it to the appropriate character templates
0,handwriting recognition is actually an application of the larger problem of identifying the significance of features in a pattern
0,a number of handheld computers beginning with apple s newton in the mid 1990s and the now popular palm devices and blackberry have some ability to recognize handwrit ing
0,however current systems can be frustrating to use 0 handwriting recognitionbecause accuracy often requires that users write very care fully and consistently or as in the case of the palm even replace their usual letter strokes with simplified alternatives that the computer can more easily recognize
0,if the user is allowed to use normal strokes the system must be gradu ally trained by the user giving writing samples and con firming the system s guess about the letters
0,as the software becomes more adaptable and processing power increases allowing more sophisticated algorithms or larger neural networks to be practical users will be able to write more naturally and systems will gain more consumer acceptance
0,one step in this direction is the tablet pc a notepad sized computer with a digitizer tablet and a stylus and handwrit ing recognitions software included in windows xp and expanded in windows vista
0,programs such as microsoft onenote use handwriting recognition to allow users to incorporate handwritten text into notes that can be orga nized and quickly retrieved
0,currently handwriting recognition is used mainly in niche applications such as collecting signatures for deliv ery services or filling out electronic forms in applications where the user must be mobile and relatively hands free
0,game consoles are computer devices dedicated to or pri marily used for playing video games
0,the earliest such devices appeared in the 1970s from magnavox and then atari and could only play simple games like pong a crude simulation of ping pong
0,slightly later systems began to feature cartridges that allowed them to play a greater vari ety of games
0,the normal method for getting a computer to perform a task is to specify the task clearly choose the appropriate approach and then implement and test the code
0,however this approach requires that the pro grammer first know the appropriate approach and even when there are many potentially suitable algorithms it isn t always clear which will prove optimal
0,variations of genetic algorithms or evolutionary program ming have been used for many applications
0,in engineering development a virtual environment can be set up in which a simulated device such as a robot arm can be allowed to evolve until it is able to perform to acceptable specifica tions
0,nasa has also used genetic programs competing on 80 computers to design a space antenna
0,different versions of an expert system program can be allowed to compete at performing tasks such as predicting the behavior of finan cial markets
0,finally a genetic program is a natural way to simulate actual biological evolution and behavior in fields such as epidemiology
0,a genetic program consists of a number of copies of a routine that contain encoded genes that represent ele ments of algorithms
0,the routines are given a task such as sorting data or recognizing patterns and the most suc cessful routines are allowed to reproduce by exchanging genetic material
0,often further mutation or variation is introduced at this stage to increase the range of available solutions
0,the new generation is then allowed to tackle the problem and the process is repeated
0,as a result the routines become increasingly efficient at solving the given problem just as organisms in nature become more perfectly adapted to a given environment
0,bill gates built microsoft the dominant company in the computer software field and in doing so became the world s wealthiest individual with a net worth measured in the tens of billions
0,born on october 28 1955 to a successful professional couple in seattle gates s teenage years coin cided with the first microprocessors becoming available to electronics hobbyists
0,gates showed both technical and business talent as early as age 15 when he developed a computerized traffic control system
0,he sold his invention for 20 000 then dropped out of high school to work as a programmer for trw for the very respectable salary of 30 000
0,by age 20 gates had returned to his schooling and become a freshman at harvard but then he saw a cover article in popular electron ics
0,the story introduced the altair the first commercially available microcomputer kit
0,geographic data can be stored as either a raster or a vector representation
0,a raster system divides the area into a grid and assigns values to each cell in the grid
0,for exam ple each cell might be coded according to its highest point of elevation the amount of vegetation ground cover it has its population density or any other factor of interest
0,the simple grid system makes raster data easy to manipulate but the data tends to be coarse since there is no informa tion about variations within a cell
0,the power of geographic information systems comes from the ability to integrate data from a variety of sources whether aerial photography census records or even scanned paper maps
0,once in digital form the data can be represented in a variety of ways for various purposes
0,a sophisticated gis can be queried to determine for example how much of a pro posed development would have a downhill gradient and be below sea level such that flooding might be a problem
0,these results can in turn be used by simulation programs to deter mine for example whether release of a chemical into the groundwater from a proposed plant site might affect a partic ula r town two miles away
0,geographic information systems are thus vital for the management of a variety of complex systems that are distributed over a geographical area such as water and sewage systems power transmission grids and traffic control systems
0,other applications include emergency planning and evacuation routes and the long term study of the effects of global warming trends
0,globalization can be described as a group of trends that are breaking down the boundaries between national and regional economies making countries more dependent on one another and resulting in the freer flow of labor and resources
0,these trends have been praised by free trade advocates and decried by proponents of labor rights and environmentalism
0,however one feels about them it is clear that global trends are reshaping the computer and information industry in many ways and pose significant challenges
0,global trends that affect computer technology software and services include offshoring or the continuing movement of manufac turing of high value components and whole systems from the industrialized west to regions such as asia outsourcing moving functions such as technical support from a company s home country to areas where suitable labor forces are cheaper removal of traditional intermediaries such as brokers and agents with some of their functions being taken over by software decentralized networks of which the internet itself is the most prominent example and the tendency of information to flow freely and quickly despite barri ers such as censorship virtualization creation of work groups or whole companies that are distributed across both space and time 24 hours coordinated by the internet and mobile communications increasing use of open source and collaborative mod els of software and information development blurring of the distinction between consumers and producers of information
0,computer related businesses must also deal with the effects of globalization on the market for hardware software and services
0,lower cost offshore manufacturing has helped contribute to making many computer systems and peripher als into commodity items
0,this certainly benefits consum ers consider the ubiquitous 100 or less computer printer
0,however it becomes more difficult to extract a premium for a brand as opposed to a generic name
0,some companies have responded by relentless efforts to maximize efficiency in manufacturing while a few others have maintained a reputation for style or innovation
0,consumers have increasingly objected however to the difficulty in dealing with offshore technical support
0,while the power of the internet has opened many new ways of reaching potential customers around the world dealing with a global marketplace brings considerable added complications such as the need to deal with different regulatory systems
0,in some areas there is also the problem of unauthor ized copying of software and media products
0,google inc nasdaq symbol goog has built a busi ness colossus by focusing on helping users find what they are looking for on the internet while selling advertising targeted at those same users
0,by 2006 to google could be found in dictionaries as a verb meaning to look up anyone or anything online
0,goog le was founded by two stanford students who for their doctoral thesis had described a web search algorithm that could give a bet ter idea of the likely relevance of a given site based on the number of sites that linked to it
0,the two students imple mented a search engine based on their ideas and hosted it on the stanford web site where its popularity soon irri tated the university s system administrators
0,in 1998 their bus iness was incorporated as google inc and moved to the archetypal silicon valley entrepreneur s location a friend s garage
0,however as the company attracted invest ment capital and grew rapidly it moved to palo alto and the n its present home in mountain view
0,google s initial public stock offering was in 2004 and the market s enthusiastic response made many senior employees instant millionaires
0,google s steady growth in subsequent years has kept its stock in demand reaching a record peak of 560 in september 2007
0,in 2006 google was added to the s p 500 index
0,prior to the late 1970s most computer applications other than some scientific and experimental ones did not use graphics
0,however the early microcomputer systems such as the apple ii radio shack trs 80 and commodore pet could all display graphics either on a monitor or with the aid of a video modulator on an ordinary tv set
0,while primitive low resolution monochrome or just a handful of colors this graphics capability allowed for a thriving mar ket in games and educational software
0,the earliest video displays for mainstream pcs pro vid ed basic text display capabilities such as the mda or monochrome display adapter with 25 lines of text up to 80 characters per line plus the ability to create graphics by setting the color of individual pixels
0,the typical low endgraphics card of the early 1980s was the cga color graphics adapter which offered various modes such as 320 by 200 pixels with four colors
0,computers marketed forprofessional use offered the ega enhanced graph ics adapter which could show 640 by 350 pixels at 16 colors
0,broadly speaking a graphics file consists of data that speci fies the color of each pixel dot in an image
0,since there are many ways this information can be organized there are a variety of graphics file formats
0,in a bitmap format there is a group of bits i e a binary value that specifies the color of each pixel
0,windows pro vides standard bitmap bmp formats for 1 bit 2 colors or monochrome 4 bit 16 colors 8 bit 256 colors or 24 bit 16 million colors
0,the windows bitmap format is also called a dib device independent bitmap because the stored colors are independent of the output device to be used such as a monitor or printer
0,the relevant device driver is responsible for translating the color to one actually used by the device
0,because it is native to windows bmp is widely used especially for program graphics resources
0,bitmap formats have the advantage of storing the exact color of every pixel without losing any information
0,how ever this means that the files can be very large from hundreds of thousands of bytes to several megabytes for windows screen graphics
0,bmp and other bitmap formats do support a simple method of compression called run length encoding rle where a series of identical pixels is replaced by a single pixel and a count
0,bitmap files can be further compressed through the use of utilities such as the popular zip program
0,eps encapsulated postscript is a vector based rather than bitmap raster format
0,this means that an eps file consists not of the actual pixel values of an image but the instruc tions for drawing the image including coordinates colors and so on
0,the instructions are specified as a text file in the versatile postscript page description language
0,this for mat is usually used for printing and requires a printer that supports postscript there are also postscript renderers that run entirely in software but they tend to be slow and some what unreliable
0,gif or graphics interchange format is a bitmapped format promulgated by compuserve
0,instead of reserving enough space to store a large number of colors in each pixel this format uses a color table that can hold up to 256 colors
0,each pixel contains a reference index into the color table
0,this means that gif works best with images that have rela tively few colors and for applications such as web pages where compactness is important
0,gif also uses compres sion to achieve compactness but unlike the case with jpeg it is a lossless compression called lzw
0,there is also a gif format that stores simple animations
0,jpeg which stands for joint photographic experts group is widely used for digital cameras because of its ability to highly compress the data in a color graphics image allow ing a reasonable number of high resolution pictures to be stored in the camera s onboard memory
0,the compression is lossy meaning that information is lost during compres sion
0,at relatively low compression ratios such as 10 1 or 10 percent of the original image size changes in the image due to data loss are unlikely to be graphics formatsperceived by the human eye
0,at higher ratios approaching 100 1 the image becomes seriously degraded
0,jpeg s abil ity to store thousands of colors unlike gif s limit of 256 makes the format particularly suitable for the subtleties of photography
0,pcx is a compressed bitmap format originally used by the popular pc paintbrush program
0,in recent years it has been largely supplanted by bmp and tiff
0,tiff or tagged image file format is also a compressed bitmap format
0,there are several variations by different vendors which can lead to compatibility problems
0,imple mentations can use various compression methods gener ally leading to ratios of 1
0,5 to 1 to about 2 to 1
0,while conventional pointing devices are quite satisfactory for making selections and even manipulat ing objects many artists prefer the control available only through a pen or pencil which allows the angle and pres sure of the stylus tip to be varied creating precise lines and shading
0,a graphics tablet also called a digitizing tablet is a device that uses a specially wired pen or pencil with a flat surface tablet
0,besides tracking the location of the pen and tra nslating it into x y screen coordinates the tablet also has pressure sensors depending on sensitivity
0,the tablet can recognize 256 512 or 1024 levels of pressure
0,in com bination with buttons on the pen the pressure level can be used to control the line thickness transparency or color
0,in addition the driver software for some graphics tablets includes additional functions such as the ability to program the pen to control features of such applications as adobe photoshop
0,this is a general term for features that reduce the growing environmental impact of the manufacture or use of comput ers
0,this impact has several aspects energy consumption resource consumption e waste and pollution and green house emissions
0,computers consume a variety of resources starting with their manufacturing and packaging
0,resource consumption can be reduced by building more compact units and by designing components so they can be more readily stripped and recycled or reused
0,adopting reusable storage media such as rewrit able cds recycling printer toner cartridges and changing office procedures to minimize the generation of paper docu ments are also ways to reduce resource consumption
0,in recent years the disposal of obsolete computers and other electronic equipment e waste has been both a grow ing concern and a business opportunity
0,there are many toxic substances in electronics components including lead mercury and cadmium
0,processing e waste to recover raw materials is expensive so greater emphasis has been placed on disassembling machines and reusing or refurbishing their individual components
0,meanwhile many communi ties have banned disposing of e waste in regular trash and some have offered opportunities to drop off e waste at no or minimal charge
0,states such as california have also insti tuted a recycling fee that is collected upon sale of devices such as crt monitors and televisions
0,fabrication of computer chips in more than 200 large plants around the world involves a variety of toxic chemicals and waste products
0,the silicon valley alone is home to 29 toxic sites under the epa s superfund program
0,the shift of much of semiconductor and computer component manufacturing to countries such as china that have less strict pollution controls has also exacerbated what has become a global problem
0,whether through regulation or enlightened self interest companies that want to reduce future emissions can use several strategies
0,manufacturing equipment and processes can be modified so they create fewer toxic substances or at least keep them from getting into the environment
0,non toxic or less toxic materials can be substituted where possible for example use of ozone depleting chlorofluo rocarbons cfcs as cleaning agents has been largely elimi nated
0,finally waste can be properly sorted and disposed of and recycled wherever feasible
0,like other major manufacturing sectors the computer industry is also faced with the need to reduce the amount of the greenhouse gases particularly co2 contributing to global warming
0,this mainly means further reducing the energy consumption of new pcs
0,in june 2007 a number of major players including google intel dell hewlett packard microsoft and sun established the climate savers computing initiative
0,going beyond energy star the pro gram is expected to reduce power consumption equivalent to 54 million tons of greenhouse gases annually about the same as that produced by 11 million cars or 20 large coal fired power plants
0,grid or cluster computing involves the creation of a sin gle computer architecture that consists of many separate computers that function much like a single machine
0,the computers are usually connected using fast networks
0,the purpose of the arrangement can be to provide redundant processing in case of system failures to dynamically balance a fluctuating work load or to split large computations into many parts that can be performed simultaneously
0,this latter approach to high performance computing creates the virtual equivalent of a very large and powerful machine
0,grid and cluster architectures often overlap but the term grid tends to be applied to a more loosely coordinated structure where the computers are dispersed over a wider area not a local network
0,in a grid the work is usually divided into many separate packets that can be processed independently without the computers having to share data
0,each task can be completed and submitted without waiting for the completion of any other task
0,clusters or the other hand more closely couple computers to act more like a single large machine
0,popular groupware software suites such as lotus notes and microsoft exchange generally offer at least some of the following features e mail coordination including the creation of group or task oriented mail lists shared calendar giving each participant information about all upcoming events meeting management including scheduling ensur ing compatibility with everyone s existing schedule and facilities booking scheduling tasks with listing of persons responsible for each task progress milestones met and check ing off completed tasks real time chat or instant message capabilities documentation systems that allow a number of people to make comments on the same document and see and respond to each other s comments whiteboard systems that allow multiple users to draw a diagram or chart in real time with everyone able to see and possibly modify it
0,grove andrew s 1936 hungarian americanentrepreneur
0,andrew grove is a pioneer in the semiconductor industry and builder of intel the corporation whose processors now power the majority of personal computers
0,grove was born andr s gr f on september 2 1936 in budapest to a jewish family
0,grove s family was disrupted by the german occupa tion of hungary later in world war ii
0,andrew s father was conscripted into a work brigade and then into a hungarian formation of the german army
0,andrew and his mother maria had to hide from the nazi roundup in which many hungarian jews were sent to death in concentration camps
0,fault tolerance is a design concept that recognizes that all computer based systems will fail eventually
0,the question is whether a system as a whole can be designed to fail grace fully
0,this means that even if one or more components fail the system will continue to operate according to its design specifications even if its speed or throughput must decrease
0,there are a number of ways to make a system more fault tolerant
0,individual components such as hard drives can be composed of multiple units so that the remaining units can take over if one fails
0,if each key component has at least one backup then there should be time to replace the primary before the backup also fails
0,another way to achieve fault tolerance is to provide mul tiple paths to successful completion of the task
0,in fact this is how packet switched networks like the internet work
0,if one communications link is down or too congested packets are given an alternative routing
0,fault diagnosis software can also play an important role both in determining how to respond to a problem beyond any automatic response and for providing data that will be useful later to system administrators or technicians
0,some fault diagnosis systems can use elaborate rules to pinpoint the cause of a fault and recommend a solution
0,the amount of fault tolerance to be provided for a sys tem depends on a number of factors how important is it that the system not fail how critical is a given component to the operation of the system how likely is it that a given component will fail
0,mean time between failures or mbtf how expensive is it to make the component or system fault tolerant
0,a fiber optic or optical fiber cable transmits photons light instead of electrons
0,depending on the diameter of the cable the light is guided either by total internal reflec tion or as a waveguide manipulating refraction
0,these principles were known as early as the mid 19th century and began to be used in the 20th century for such applications as dental and medical illumination and in experiments in transmitting images for television
0,optical fiber in its modern form was developed in the 1950s
0,the glass fiber through which the light passes is surrounded by a transparent cladding designed to provide the needed refractive index to keep the light confined
0,the cladding in turn is surrounded by a resin buffer layer and often an outer jacket and plastic cover
0,fiber used for com munication is flexible allowing it to bend if necessary
0,early optical fiber could not be used for practical com munication because of progressive attenuation weakening of the light as it traveled
0,however by the 1970s the attenu ation was being reduced to acceptable levels by removing impurities from the fibers
0,today the light signals can travel hundreds of miles without the need for repeaters or amplifi ers
0,in the 1990s a new type of optical fiber photonic crys tal using diffraction became available
0,this kind of fiber is particularly useful in applications that require higher power signals
0,optical fiber has several advantages over ordinary electric cable for communications and networking
0,the signals can travel much farther without the need for a repeater to boost the signal
0,also the ability to modulate wavelengths allows optical fiber to carry many separate channels greatly increas ing the total data throughput
0,optical fiber does not emit rf radio frequency energy a source of cross talk interfer ence in electrical cable
0,fiber is also more secure than elec trical cable because it is hard for an eavesdropper to tap
0,today fiber is used for most long distance phone lines and internet connections
0,many cable television systems are upgrading from video cable to fiber because of its greater reliability and ability to carry more bandwidth and enhanced data services
0,at bottom information in a computer is stored as a series of bits which can be grouped into larger units such as bytes or words that represent particular numbers or characters
0,in order to be stored and retrieved a collection of such binary data must be given a name and certain attributes that describe how the information can be accessed
0,this named entity is the file
0,the file system is the facility of the operating system that organizes files
0,for example on dos and older windows pcs there is a file allocation table fat that consists of a linked list of clusters each cluster consists of a fixed number of sectors varying with the overall size of the disk
0,when the operating system is asked to access a file it can go through the table and find the clusters belonging to that file read the data and send it to the requesting applica tio n modern file systems further organize files into groups called folders or directories which can be nested several lay ers deep
0,such a hierarchical file system makes it easier for users to organize the dozens of applications and thousands of files found on today s pcs
0,for example a folder called book might have a subfolder for each chapter which in turn con tains folders for text and illustrations relating to that chapter
0,the ultimate organization of data in a file depends on the application
0,a typical approach is to define a data record with various fields
0,the program might have a loop that repeatedly requests a record from the file processes it in some way and repeats until the operating system tells it that it has reached the end of the file
0,this would be a sequential access a program can also be set up for ran dom access which means that an arbitrary record can be requested and that request will be translated into the cor rect physical location in the file
0,the two approaches can be combined in isam indexed sequential access method where the records are stored sequentially but fields are indexed so a particular record can be retrieved
0,the growth in desktop computing since the 1980s has resulted in much data being moved from mainframe com puters to desktop pcs which are now usually linked by networks
0,while a network enables users to exchange files there remains the problem of storing large files or collec tions of files such as databases that are too large for a typi cal pc hard drive or that need to be accessed and updated by many users
0,the common solution is to obtain a computer with large fast disk drives
0,this computer the file server is equipped with software often included with the networking package that serves provides files as requested by users or applications on the other pcs on the network
0,see also client servercomputing
0,the specifics of configuring the server for optimum efficiency providing adequate security and arranging for backup or archiving varies with the particular network operating sys tem in use the most popular environments are windows nt vista and the various versions of unix and linux
0,the file server has many advantages over storing the files needed by each user on his or her own pc
0,by storing the files on a central server ordinary users pcs do not need to have larger more expensive disk drives
0,central storage also makes it easier to ensure that backups are run regularly
0,file sharing services allow participants to provide access to files on their personal computers such as music or video
0,in turn the user can browse the service to find and down load material of interest
0,the structure is generally that of a peer to peer p2p network with no central server
0,the first major file sharing service was napster
0,this was a p2p network but had a central server that provided the searchable list of files and locations but not the files themselves which were downloaded from users pcs
0,napster was forced to close in 2001 by legal action from copyright holders
0,a new but unrelated for pay service opened later under the same name
0,many services today use the popular bittorrent file shar ing protocol
0,a bittorrent client either the program of that name or another compatible one can transmit or receive any type of data
0,to share a file the client creates a tor rent a small file that contains metadata describing the file and an assignment to a tracker
0,the tracker is another computer node that coordinates the distribution of the file
0,although this sounds complicated and a request takes longer to set up than an ordinary http connection the advantage is that once set up downloading is efficiently managed even for files for which there is high demand
0,the downloading client connects to multiple clients that provide pieces of the desired file
0,because of its efficiency bittorrent allows for distribution of substantial amounts of data at low cost particularly since the system scales up automatically without having to provide extra resources
0,bittorrent is currently being used for a variety of legally distributed material including video sound and textual content
0,because of their frequent use to share copyrighted music video or other material a variety of organizations of copy right owners have sued file sharing services and or their users
0,the biggest problem for the courts is to determine whether there is substantial non infringing use that is the service is being used to exchange legal data
0,some file sharing services have been accused of dis tributing malware viruses or spyware or of being used to distribute material that is illegal per se such as child pornography
0,in response to litigation threats file sharing services have tended to become more decentralized and some have features that increase anonymity of users or use encryption
0,with today s networked pcs and the use of e mail attach ments it is easy to send a copy of a file or files from one computer to another because networks already include all the facilities for doing so
0,earlier many pcs were not net worked but could be connected via a dial up modem
0,to established the connection a terminal program running on one pc had to negotiate with its counterpart on the other machine agreeing on whether data would be sent in 7 or 8 bit chunks and the number of parity bits that would be included for error checking
0,the sending program would inform the receiving program as to the name and basic type of the file
0,for binary files files intended to be interpreted as literal binary codes as with executable programs images and so on the contents would be sent unchanged
0,for text files there might be the issue of which character set 7 bit or 8 bit ascii was being used and whether the ends of lines were to be marked with a cr carriage return character an lf linefeed or bot
0,once the programs agree on the basic parameters for a file transfer the transfer has to be managed to ensure that it completes correctly
0,typically files are divided into blocks of data such as 1k or 1024 bytes each
0,during the 1970s ward christensen developed xmodem the first widely used file transfer program for pcs running cp m and later ms dos and other operating systems
0,xmodem was quite reli able because it incorporated a checksum and later a more advanced crc to check the integrity of each data block
0,if an error is detected the receiving program requests a retransmission
0,the role of the computer in film begins well before the first camera rolls
0,writers can use computers to write scripts while specialized programs can be used to lay out storyboards
0,using 3d programs somewhat like cad drafting programs set designers can experiment with the positioning of objects before deciding on a final design and obtaining or creating the physical props
0,for mattes backgrounds against which the characters will be shot in a scene a computer generated scene can now be inserted directly into the film without the need for an expensive hand painted backdrop
0,there are many calculations or other processes that can be described using a specific series of states or conditions
0,for example the state of a combination lock depends not only on what numeral is being dialed or punched at the moment but on the numbers that have been previously entered
0,an even simpler example is a counter such as a car odometer whose next output is equal to one increment plus its cur rent setting
0,in other words a state based device has an inherent memory of previous steps
0,many programs and operating systems are structured as an endless loop where an input or command is processed the results returned the next input is processed and so on until an exit command is received
0,a mode or state can be used to determine the system s activity
0,for example a program might be in different modes such as waiting for input processing input displaying results and so on
0,the program logic will refer to the current state to determine what to do next and at some point the logic will transitionthe system to the next state in the sequence
0,the validity of some kinds of programs protocols or circuits can therefore be proven by showing that there is an equivalent finite state machine and thus that all possible combinations of inputs have been accounted for
0,finite state machines have many other interesting appli cations
0,simple organisms can be modeled as a set of states that interact with the environment
0,the lower level functions of robots can also be represented as a set of interacting finite state machines
0,even video game characters often use fsms to give them a repertoire of plausible behavior
0,the vulnerability of computer systems to malicious or criminal attack has been greatly increased by the growing number of connections between computers and local net works and the worldwide internet
0,the widespread use of permanent broadband connections by consumers such as dsl and cable modem links has increased the risk to home users
0,intruders can use port scanning programs to determine what connections a given system or network has open and can use other programs to snoop and steal or destroy sensitive data
0,typical firewall functions include examining incoming data packets and blocking those that include commands to examine or use unauthor ized ports or ip addresses blocking data packets that are associated with com mon hacking techniques such as trojans or back door exploitationsthis diagram shows a finite state representation of a zip code
0,the arrows link each state within a circle to its possible successor
0,in this simple example each digit must be followed by another digit until the fifth digit which can either be followed by a blank indi cating a five digit zip code or four more digits for a 9 digit zip
0,firewall hiding all the internal network addresses on a local network presenting only a single address to the outside world this is also called nat or network address translation monitoring particular applications such as ftp file transfer protocol and telnet remote login restrict ing them to certain addresses
0,often a special address called a proxy is established rather than allowing direct connections between the outside and the local network
0,firewire is a high speed serial interface used by personal computers and digital audio and video equipment
0,the name firewire is an apple brand name but it is used gener ically
0,technically it is the ieee 1394 serial bus
0,firewire was developed in the 1990s by the ieee p1394 working group with substantial funding from apple and help from engineers from major corporations including ib m digital equipment corporation dec sony and texas instruments
0,in 1993 it was hailed as the most sig nificant new technology by byte magazine
0,common uses for firewire include connecting digital video such as camcorder devices audio devices and some data storage devices
0,firewire is favored over usb 2
0,0 for many professional applications because of its higher speed and power distribution capabilities
0,however it is more expensive than usb 2
0,0 which provides sufficient speed for many consumer peripherals such as digital cameras and printers
0,a flag is a variable that is used to specify a particular condi tion or status
0,usually a flag is either true or false
0,for example a flag valid form could be set to true before the input form is processed
0,if the validation check for any data field fails the flag would be set to false
0,after the input procedure has ended the main program would check the valid form flag
0,if it s true the data on the form is processed for example continuing on to the payment process
0,if the flag is false the input form might be redis played with errors or omissions highlighted
0,in computers the term flash mob typically refers to a group of individuals who organize a spontaneous and coordinated online activity such as a social media campaign or an online protest
0,flash mobs often use social media platforms and other online tools to mobilize large groups of people quickly and efficiently
0,flash mobs can take many different forms ranging from coordinated tweets or facebook posts to more elaborate online events such as virtual marches or protests
0,they are often used to draw attention to a particular cause raise awareness about an issue or promote a message or idea
0,smart mobs are similar in organization to flash mobs but tend to be more purposeful and enduring forms of social organization
0,the phenomenon was first described by how ard rheingold in his book smart mobs the next social revolution
0,rheingold describes several examples of smart mobs including teenage thumb tribes in tokyo and helsinki finland named for their use of tiny thumb operated keyboards on cell phones
0,their typical activities included organizing impromptu raves or converging on rock stars or other celebrities
0,a flash or thumb drive is a small data storage device that uses semiconductor flash memory rather than a disk drive
0,it is connected to a digital device using the universal serial bus
0,because most computers digital cameras and other digital devices have usb ports a flash drive is a convenient way to provide up to 16 gb as of 2007 of low power rewritable memory
0,flash drives first appeared in late 2000
0,flash drives can use a separate usb cable useful when several devices need to be connected to closely spaced usb ports or simply have a connector that plugs directly into the port
0,many people who regularly work with several computers carry their backup data or even a complete oper ating system such as linux on a flash drive perhaps con nected to their keyring
0,the traditional computer display uses a cathode ray tube crt like that in a television set
0,the flat panel display is an alternative used in most laptop com puters and some higher end desktop systems
0,the most common type uses a liquid crystal display lcd
0,the dis play consists of a grid of cells with one cell for each of the three colors red green and blue for each pixel
0,until the mid 1990s the floppy disk or diskette was the primary method for distributing software and providing removable data storage for personal computers
0,diskettes first appeared in the late 1960s on ibm minicomputers and became more widespread on a variety of minicomputers and early microcomputers during the 1970s
0,the now obsolete 8 inch and 5 inch disks were made from mylar with a metal oxide coating the assembly being housed in a flexible cardboard jacket hence the term floppy disk
0,the more compact 3
0,5 inch diskettes first widely introduced with the apple macintosh in 1984 became the standard type for all pcs by the 1990s
0,these diskettes are no longer truly floppy and come in a rigid plastic case
0,a flowchart is a diagram showing the flow or progress of operations in a computer program
0,flowcharting was one of the earliest aids to program design and documentation and a plastic template with standard flowcharting symbols was a common programming accessory
0,today case com puter aided software engineering systems often include utilities that can automatically generate flowcharts based on the control structures and procedure calls found in the program code
0,the standard flowchart symbols include blocks of vari ous shapes that represent input output data processing sorting and collating and so on
0,lines with arrows indicate the flow of data from one stage or process to the next
0,a diamond shaped symbol indicates a decision to be made by the program
0,if the decision is an if separate lines branch off to the alternatives
0,if the decision involves repeated testing the line returns back to the decision point while another line indi cates the continuation of processing after the loop exits
0,devices such as printers and disk drives have their own symbols with lines indicating the flow of data to or from the device
0,in computing a font refers to a typeface that has a distinc tive appearance and style
0,in most word processing desk top publishing and other programs the user can select the point size at which the font is to be displayed and printed in traditional typography each point size would be consid ered to be a separate font
0,operating systems such as win a flowchart uses a set of simple symbols to describe the steps involved in a data processing operation
0,the parallelograms indi cate an input output operation such as reading or writing a file
0,the decision diamonds have yes and no branches depending on the result of a test or comparison
0,00 flowchartdows and macintosh usually come with an assortment of fonts and applications can register additional fonts to make them available to the system
0,there are two basic ways to store font data in the computer system
0,bitmapped fonts store the actual pat tern of tiny dots that make up the letters in the font
0,this has the advantage of allowing each letter in each point size to be precisely designed
0,the primary disadvantage is the amount of memory and system resources required to store a font in many point sizes
0,in practice this con sideration results in only a relatively few fonts and sizes being available
0,forth has a very simple structure
0,the forth system con sists of a collection of words
0,each word is a sequence of operations which can include other existing words
0,for example the dup word makes a copy of a data value
0,data is held by a stack
0,for example the arithmetic expression written as 2 3 in most languages would be written in forth as 2 3
0,when the operator which in forth is a pre defined word executes it adds the next two numbers it encounters 2 and 3 together and puts the sum on the stack where in turn it might be fetched for further process ing by the next word in the program
0,this rep resentation is also called postfix notation and is familiar to many users of scientific calculators
0,a key feature of forth is its extensibility
0,once you have defined a word the new word can be used in exactly the same way as the predefined words
0,the various forms of defining words allow for great control over what happens when a new word is created and when the word is later executed
0,in many ways forth anticipated the principles of object oriented programming with words as objects with implicit construc tors and methods
0,a well organized forth program builds up from primitive operations to the higher level words with the program itself being the highest level word
0,fortran formula translator was the first widely used high level programming language
0,it was developed by a project begun in 1954 by a team under the leadership of i bm researcher john backus
0,the goal of the project was to create a language that would allow mathematicians sci entists and engineers to express calculations in something close to the traditional notation
0,at the same time a com piler would have to be carefully designed so that it would produce executable machine code that would be nearly as efficient as the code that would have been created through the more tedious process of using assembly languages
0,see compiler and assembler
0,fractals and the related idea of chaos have profoundly changed the way scientists think about and model the world
0,around 1960 benoit mandelbrot noticed that sup posedly random economic fluctuations were not distributed evenly but tended to form clumps
0,as he investigated other sources of data he found that many other things exhibited this odd behavior
0,he also discovered that the patterns of distribution were self similar that is if you magnified a portion of the pattern it looked like a miniature copy of the whol e mandelbrot coined the term fractal meaning frac tured or broken up to describe such patterns
0,eventually a number of simple mathematical functions were found to exhibit such behavior in generating values
0,many computer users are familiar with the colorful fractal patterns generated by some screen savers
0,there are hun dreds of families of fractals beginning with the famous mandelbrot set that can be color coded and displayed in endless detail
0,but there are a number of more significant applications
0,because of their ability to generate realistic textures at every level of detail many computer games and simulations use fractals to generate terrain interactively
0,fractals can also be used to compress large digital images into a much smaller equivalent by creating a mathemati cal transformation that preserves and can be used to re cre ate the essential characteristics of the image
0,military experts can use fractal analysis either to distinguish artifi cial objects from surrounding terrain or camouflage or to generate more realistic camouflage
0,fractals and chaos the ory are likely to produce many surprising discoveries in the future in areas ranging from signal analysis and encryption to economic forecasting
0,functional languages have generally been used for special ized purposes although they can in principle perform any task that an imperative language can
0,apl which is basi cally a functional language has devotees who appreciate its compact and powerful syntax for performing calculations
0,lisp and its variants have long been favored for many artificial intelligence applications particularly natu ral language processing where its representation of data as lists and the facility of its list processing functions seems a natural fit
0,proponents of functional languages argue that they free the programmer from having to be concerned with explic itly setting up and using variables
0,in a functional language problems can often be stated in a more purely mathematical way
0,further because functional programs are not orga nized as sequentially executed tasks it may be easier to implement parallel processing systems using functional languages
0,however critics point out that imperative languages are much closer to how computers actually work employing actual storage locations and sequential operation and thus produce code likely to be much faster and more efficient than that produced by functional languages
0,at bottom a data bit in a computer is all or nothing 1 or 0
0,most decisions in computer code are also all or nothing either a condition is satisfied and execution takes one specified path or the condition is not satisfied and it goes elsewhere
0,in real life of course many situations fall between the cracks
0,for example a business might want to treat a credit applicant who almost qualifies for a status different from one who barely made b
0,while a program could be refined to include many gradations between b and a another approach is to express the degree of closeness or certainty using fuzzy logic
0,ebayebay inc nasdaq symbol ebay is the world s largest online auction and shopping site
0,the first appearance of the auction service was in 1995 as auctionweb part of the personal web site of pierre omidyar
0,omidyar was surprised at how rapidly the auction service which was initially free grew
0,after he imposed a modest listing fee omidyar found himself receiving thousands of dollars in small checks and decided that online auctions could become a full time business
0,an e book is a book whose text is stored in digital form and can be read on a pc or a handheld reading device
0,since most books today are created on word processors and typesetting systems it is easy for a publisher to create an electronic version
0,older books that exist only in printed form can be scanned and converted to text
0,a digital library is to e books what a conventional library is to printed books
0,sometimes called an electronic library or virtual library digital libraries can be created in a variety of ways
0,printed books can now be scanned and digitized rapidly
0,google has said that it can scan 3 000 volumes a day using a proprietary system
0,this is not necessary of course for books that were originally created in digital form
0,advantages of digital libraries include the following 166
0,
0,e books and digital libraries there is never a shortage of copies or the need for a reader to wait for access
0,
0,many digital libraries allow full searching of the text of all volumes
0,libraries can also use a common data format such as open archives
0,to make their material searchable throughout the internet
0,
0,many older hard to find books can be made more discoverable and accessible
0,the most popular e commerce sectors today include the selling of books music and movies travel related services electronics clothing luxury goods and medications
0,in 2006 online buyers actually spent more money on clothing than on computers and related products
0,a number of other online activities can be considered part of e commerce although they are usually not included in retailing statistics
0,one continuing obstacle to the growth of e commerce has been consumers concerns about the theft or misuse of personal information gathered as part of the shopping process
0,this can involve either fake web sites or legitimate businesses that sell information about customers without their knowledge or consent
0,according to a report from gartner research more than 900 million in e commerce sales during 2006 was lost because of consumers security concerns and about a billion dollars more in sales was lost because customers decided not to buy online at all
0,in the early 1950s knowledge of computing tended to have and hoc nature
0,on the practical level computing staffs tended to train newcomers in the specific hardware and machine level programming languages in use at a particular site
0,on the theoretical level programmers in scientific fields were likely to come from a background in electronics electrical engineering or similar disciplines
0,as it became clear that computers were going to play an increasingly important role courses specific to computing were added to curricula in mathematics and engineering
0,by the late 1950s however leading people in the computing field had become convinced that a formal curriculum in computer science was necessary for further advance in an increasingly sophisticated computing arena
0,by the early 1960s efforts at the university of michigan university of houston stanford and other institutions had resulted in the creation of separate graduate departments of computer science
0,by the mid 1960s the national academy of sciences and the president s science advisory committee had both called for a major expansion of efforts in computer science education to be aided by federal funding
0,during the 1970s and 1980s mathematical and engineering societies in particular the association for computing machinery acm and institute for electrical and electronic engineering ieee worked to established detailed computer science curricula that extended to undergraduate study
0,by 2000 there were 155 accredited programs in computer science in the united states
0,basic was invented at dartmouth college in 1963 1964 by john g kemeny and thomas e kurtz both professors of mathematics assisted by a group of undergraduate student programmers
0,computers then were huge slow and expensive there were no personal computers
0,their goal was to bring easy and accessible computing to all students not just science or engineering students
0,the method they chose called for developing a time shared operating system which would allow many users simultaneously
0,this operating system was developed entirely by dartmouth undergraduate students
0,the new language basic easy to learn and easy to use was an essential part of this effort
0,basic was thus developed originally for a large multipleuser time shared system and not for personal computers which did not appear widely until the early 1980s
0,it has been asked whybasicwas invented
0,couldn t an existing language have been used for the purpose
0,the answer to the second question is no which also answers the first question
0,other computer languages did exist in 1963 although there were not nearly as many as there are today
0,the principal ones were fortran and algol most of the others are long since forgotten
0,some of the common languages used today c c and java had not even been conceived
0,fortran and algol were each considered briefly
0,these languages were designed for production use on big machines or for scientific research using punched cards
0,but neither was suitable for use by beginners neither was particularly well suited for a time shared environment and neither permitted speedy handling of short programs
0,kemeny and kurtz had experimented with other simple computer languages as early as 1956 but with only modest success
0,so in 1963 when they began building a time shared system for students they quickly realized that a new language had to be invented basic
0,timing attacks were publicized by paul kocher in 1996
0,they attack the implementation of cryptosystems by measuring observable differences in the timing of the algorithm based on the particular value of the key
0,they then use statistical methods to determine the bits of key by observing many operations using the same key
0,timing attacks typically require a significant number of chosen ciphertexts
0,related attacks can use any measure of differences in the performance of the encryption and decryption functions such as power consumption and heat dissipation
0,timing attacks and related attacks can be protected against to some degree by blinding the devices performing encryption and decryption computations so that all computations have the same performance regardless of the particular key and message being used
0,however this can have a substantial performance cost as it requires all computations to have worst case performance
0,such attacks can also be protected against by designing systems so that they will not act as an oracle by decrypting and returning all and any messages that come their way thereby preventing an attacker from obtaining the necessary data to carry out the attack
0,however this is not always possible without interfering with the purpose of the system
0,the arithmetic logic unit is the part of a computer system that actually performs calculations and logical comparisons on data
0,it is part of the central processing unit cpu and in practice there may be separate and multiple arithmetic and logic units
0,the alu works by first retrieving a code that represents the operation to be performed such as add
0,the code also specifies the location from which the data is to be retrieved and to which the results of the operation are to be stored
0,for example addition of the data from memory to a num ber already stored in a special accumulator register within the cpu with the result to be stored back into the accumu lator
0,the operation code can also include a specification of the format of the data to be used such as fixed or float ing point numbers the operation and format are often combined into the same code
0,in addition to arithmetic operations the alu can also carry out logical comparisons such as bitwise operations that compare corresponding bits in two data words corresponding to boolean operators such as and or and xor
0,the data or operand specified in the operation code is retrieved as words of memory that represent numeric data or indirectly character data
0,once the operation is per formed the result is stored typically in a register in the cpu
0,special codes are also stored in registers to indicate characteristics of the result such as whether it is positive negative or zero
0,other special conditions called excep tions indicate a problem with the processing
0,common exceptions include overflow where the result fills more bits than are available in the register loss of precision because there isn t room to store the necessary number of decimal places or an attempt to divide by zero
0,exceptions are typically indicated by setting a flag in the machine status register
0,an applet is a small program that uses the resources of a larger program and usually provides customization or addi tional features
0,the term first appeared in the early 1990s in connection with apple s applescript scripting language for the macintosh operating system
0,today java applets rep resent the most widespread use of this idea in web develop ment
0,java applets are compiled to an intermediate repre sentation called bytecode and generally are run in a web browser
0,applets thus represent one of several alternatives for interacting with users of web pages beyond what can be accomplished using simple text markup
0,an applet can be invoked by inserting a reference to its program code in the text of the web page using the html applet element or the now preferred object element
0,although the distinction between applets and scripting code such as in php is somewhat vague applets usually run in their own window or otherwise provide their own interface while scripting code is generally used to tailor the behavior of separately created objects
0,applets are also rather like plug ins but the latter are generally used to provide a particular capability such as the ability to read or play a particular kind of media file and have a stan dardized facility for their installation and management
0,some common uses for applets include animations of scientific or programming concepts for web pages support ing class curricula and for games designed to be played using web browsers
0,animation tools such as flash and shockwave are often used for creating graphic applets
0,to prevent badly or maliciously written applets from affecting user files applets such as java applets are gen erally run within a restricted or sandbox environment where for example they are not allowed to write or change files on disk
0,in personal computers a chipset is a group of integrated circuits that together perform a particular function
0,system purchasers generally think in terms of the processor itself such as a pentium iii pentium iv or competitive chips from amd or cyrix
0,however they are really buying a system chipset that includes the microprocessor itself and often a memory cache which may be part of the microprocessor or a separate chip see cache as well as the chips that control the memory bus which connects the processor to the main memory on the moth erboard see bus
0,the overall performance of the system depends not just on the processor s architecture including data width instruction set and use of instruction pipe lines but also on the type and size of the cache memory the memory bus rdram or rambus and sdram and the speed with which the processor can move data to and from memory
0,in addition to the system chipset other chipsets on the motherboard are used to support functions such as graphics the agp or advanced graphics port for example drive connection eide controller communication with exter nal devices and connections to expansion cards the pci bus
0,at the end of the 1990s the pc marketplace had chip sets based on two competing architectures
0,intel which originally developed an architecture called socket 7 has switched to the more complex slot 1 architecture which is most effective for multiprocessor operation but offers the advantage of including a separate bus for accessing the cac he memory
0,meanwhile intel s main competitor amd has enhanced the socket 7 into super socket 7 and is offering faster bus speeds
0,on the horizon may be com pletely new architecture
0,in choosing a system consumers are locked into their choice because the microprocessor pin sockets used for each chipset architecture are different
0,a class is a data type that combines both a data structure and methods for manipulating the data
0,for example a string class might consist of an array to hold the charac ters in the string and methods to compare strings combine strings or extract portions of a string
0,as with other data types once a class is declared objects sometimes called instances of the class can be created and used
0,this way of structuring programs is called object oriented programming because the class object is the basic building block
0,object oriented programming and classes provide sev eral advantages over traditional block structured languages
0,in a traditional basic or even pascal program there is no particular connection between the data structure and the procedures or functions that manipulate it
0,in a large program one programmer might change the data structure without alerting other programmers whose code assumes the original structure
0,on the other hand someone might write a procedure that directly manipulates the internal data rather than using the methods already provided
0,either transgression can lead to hard to find bugs
0,with a class however data and procedures are bound together or encapsulated
0,this means that the data in a class object can be manipulated only by using one of the methods provided by the class
0,if the person in charge of maintaining the class decides to provide an improved implementation of the data structure as long as the data parameters expected by the class methods do not change code that uses the class objects will continue to function properly
0,access control matrix means preparing a system permitting to bring together user and the system s available resources
0,preparing a matrix requires the following steps a broad level of groups of resources that share the same or similar security objectives is established based on requirements for confidentiality integrity availability user accountability authentication and audit compliance cia uaa
0,the resources include files directories applications databases hosts services processes and others including those protected by the operating system or by other mechanisms
0,users are grouped according to common security needs into functional teams and a group owner is identified who is responsible for group management if necessary naming standards for resources can be defined based on the findings under 1 2 above thereby further facilitating resource groupings
0,now a decision can be made on the degree of access such as read write execute take ownership access control delete purge modify file scan
0,balancing central security control and group administration decides about the involvement of security administration
0,a corporation s access control matrix should not become a static document but instead regular review and improvement is a must
0,this matrix is closely linked to a role based access management system whereby user roles e g nurse versus private or general physician have roles to perform requiring access and modification of data or addition of new information regarding an electronic patient file
0,active os fingerprinting is conducted in order to detect the target s oper ating system
0,it is usually done by sending specially crafted network packets and comparing them against known responses
0,each operating system re sponds to different packet differently and even response to the ping command can give a good indication of the target os
0,several methods have been developed and fingerprints are widely available on the internet
0,the tool of the trade for this is a tool called network mapper nmap
0,while active os fingerprinting is more accurate than passive os fingerprinting it has a significant disadvantage
0,being active means that attackers have to send packets to the host hence active versus passive fingerprinting means risking discovery
0,is a method used for dynamic web sites pages thatincludes one or more scripts small embedded programs that are processedon a web server before the page is sent to the user
0,an asp is somewhat similarto a server side include or a common gateway interface cgi application inthat it involves programs that run on the server usually tailoring a page forthe user
0,typically the script in the web page at the server uses input receivedas the result of the user s request for the page to access data from a database thereafter it builds or customizes the page on the fly before sending it to therequestor
0,are similar to java applets in that activex controls may be includedwithin a web page
0,the control is downloaded and executed on the browser scomputer in the form of a pre compiled executable
0,unfortunately activexdoes not enforce any form of security management technology
0,hence activex control has the same level of control of the client computer as theuser that is executing the browser
0,activex controls are specific to microsoftinternet explorer msie
0,activex controls are elements that can be added to web pages therebyproviding them with more functionality e g animation video and threedimensional browsing
0,the controls are written in programming languagessuch as visual basic c or c
0,they are written in a different code than theone used for the web pages itself such as html
0,they could however beinfected with malicious code malware
0,whatever risks are associated with running native executables on a computer also apply to activex
0,how security of activex controls is handled isat the user s discretion who runs the browser
0,without appropriate training this may be risky justifying disabling this functionality within webbrowsers by setting security settings to high activex is prevented fromrunning
0,advisory and notification markup language anml is an extensible markup language xml based specification for describing advisories and other types of notifications
0,anml is currently being developed to help in solving the inconsistent use of terminology by software vendors in their advisories
0,the hope is that anml will make it easy for applications to read these advisories
0,this will make way for the necessary tools to automatically update systems
0,although anml will have its biggest impact for security advisories it can be used for any type of notification
0,some examples include bug fixes feature enhancements upgrade availability and many more
0,more information can be found in appendix 1 opensec and appendix 6 under adml
0,pronounced al go rith um is a procedure or formula for solving a problem
0,the word derives from the name of the mathematician mohammed ibn musa al khwarizmi who was part of the royal court in baghdad and who lived from about 780 to 850
0,al khwarizmi s work is the likely source for the word algebra as well
0,algorithm is any well defined procedure does not have to be computa tional that takes some value or set of values as input and produces some value or set of values as output
0,it is a technique that comes with a guarantee
0,the technique for ratio nal function integration is an algorithm because it always produces the an swer without exception
0,differentiation is an algorithm given an elemen tary function you can always find its derivative
0,algorithms can be fast or slow but the important thing is the guarantee
0,in some sense an algorithm is a predictable heuristic whereby one cannot tell if a heuristic will work before one tries it but one knows in advance what the output of an algorithm will be
0,in computing terms algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input to the output
0,a computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm
0,in mathe matics and computer science an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem
0,in this context the term virus algorithm means a set of operations or a procedure designed to create a virus problem
0,in the context of digital signatures or encryption the algorithm describes how the signature or text is encrypted using mathematical formulas another example is the condensation algorithm conditional density propagation that allows quite general representations of probability
0,the simplicity of the condensation algorithm also allows the use of non linear motion models more complex than those commonly used in kalman filters
0,using the statistical technique of importance sampling it is possible to build a condensation tracker which runs in real time tracking a dancer or a hand as they move
0,apache is a freely available multiplatform web server
0,it is currently the most commonly used server on internet connected sites
0,its genesis was in early 1995 when developers of some high visibility web sites decided to pool their patches and enhancements to the ncsa 1
0,3 server to create a patchy server
0,the project has since gained considerable momentum
0,ascii american standard code for information interchange is a series of standards used to identify simple characters numbers letters etc
0,where each character is represented by a numerical code
0,each character is assigned a 7 bit code whereby the bit has a minimum unit of data 0 zero or 1
0,ascii files can be created using simple text editors
0,ascii is a universal computer code for english letters and characters
0,computers store all information as binary numbers regardless of what make or brand the computer is
0,ascii also refers to a protocol for copying files from one computer to another over a network in which neither computer checks for any errors that might have been caused by static or other problems
0,the difficulty with ascii is twofold 1 2 all special fonts and elements used in a document typed using one software e g wordperfect will be lost when the file document is saved in ascii format and than reloaded by somebody else into wordperfect or even microsoft word for that matter and special characters such as those used in german cannot be transferred by ascii e g is transferred as a blank and an ue must be typed instead
0,besides german for many languages e g chinese and japanese this represents a real problem
0,for the above reasons a new source called unicode was developed
0,as 8 bit codes only allow for 256 separate characters a single 8 bit en coding is not suitable for all text requirements
0,even western alphabets have many characters and once languages of china and braille are included there are many thousands of characters that are needed
0,of course within a given domain an implicit assumption of a particular character set could be made
0,this leads to multiple 8 bit codes
0,but it doesn t work for those character sets where more than 256 characters are needed in the same context
0,both 7 bit ascii and the various 8 bit extensions of it can be considered to be subsets of unicode
0,one does not need to know the above level of detail but it is important to see why ascii is insufficient and why a standard is required for character encodings
0,asymmetrical digital subscriber line adsl allows voice video anddata to be transmitted over a single telephone line at up to 6
0,144 megabitsper second mbps in a single direction with significantly slower speedsin the other direction
0,accordingly it is very appropriate for downloading large amounts of data but for certain applications such as videoconferencing other technologies work better see also very high bit ratedigital subscriber line vdsl discrete multi tone dmt modulation quadrature amplitude modulation qam vdsl
0,attack is a single unauthorized access attempt or unauthorized use attempt regardless of success
0,success may or may not result in the alteration releasing or denying of data
0,the likelihood of success depends on the effectivenessof implemented security measures that reduce the risk and probability for athreat resulting in a compromised system
0,computernetworks make it easier to start attacks and speed their dissemination or forone anonymous individual to reach vast numbers of people at virtually nocost
0,defending against attacks means engineering in a world ruled by satan slaw
0,the differences between attacks and accidents are intent intelligence and control
0,things go wrong because there is a malicious and intelligentadversary trying to force things to go wrong table 3a outlines a taxonomy of the attacks that can be launched againstinformation resources and infrastructure
0,authentication results in positively verifying the identity of a user device or another entity in an information system
0,this is often a prerequisite for allowing access to resources offered by a system
0,one element that contributes to the reliability of individual authentication is good password management practices
0,in an area of high risk stronger authentication may be required such as asymmetric keys see access control biometrics see biometrics cryptographic tokens see cryptography digital certificates see digital certificate smart cards see smart card one time password generators where password can be used once only
0,stronger authentication relies on combining one or more of the following password pin or something else user knows token or other means that is something user has and finally biometrics or other technique enabling system to identify who the person is
0,the above means may be used to verify the true source of a message or data
0,but all approaches have their weak spots and combinations of measures are usually more effective
0,in case of electronic voting the term refers to verification that an electronic ballot really comes from the person it claims to have been initiated by and not from an imposter
0,backdoor is a hidden feature of an application prepared by its designer ormaintainers
0,the backdoor gives the programmer special privileges for running the application
0,these privileges are not available to the user
0,the motivation for such holes is not always sinister some operating systems for example come out of the box with privileged accounts intended foruse by field service technicians or the vendor s maintenance programmers
0,but we are not sure if such an account should be called backdoor in ourunderstanding backdoor is a hidden feature
0,yes these accounts were sometimes hidden microsoft nt 3
0,51 and then they could be called backdoors but generally they are not hidden
0,batch files are files usually describing automated sequence of commands
0,these are used in mainframe operations where even special languages weredeveloped for creation of batches
0,shell scripts known in the unix worldcan also be considered in some cases as batch files
0,in ms dos and mswindows context these files are characterized by a
0,bat extension
0,thesetext files contain ms dos commands one on each line of the file that areprocessed in sequential order for example when the computer is booted e g autoexec
0,bat
0,binders are programs permitting hackers to bind two or more programstogether resuling in a single
0,exe file
0,hence harmless
0,exe animations e greetings or other such files could have a trojan horse inserted
0,the only way to stop an executable from harming a pc or system is to run itin a proactive sandbox environment and monitor its behavior for maliciousactivity in real time
0,biometrics identification systems are based on the recognition of unique morphological characteristics of each individual so that only the physical presence of the person will allow access to the system
0,numerous biometric parameters are available such as facial iris fingerprints hand and finger geometry signature and voice recognition
0,although iris recognition has stronger security credentials fingerprints are often preferred due to the maturity of the technology
0,as table 4a outlines retina scan iris scan and hand geometry are most accurate and both the false rejection rate frr and the false acceptance rate far are quite low for these authentication measures based on biometrics
0,in table 4b other measures are outlined that can be used for access control
0,often a system may use a magnetic swipe card and a keypad entry system to give an employee access to a restricted office area or a database
0,some of the time a system such as the ones outlined in table 4b may also be combined with one of those described and explained in table 4c
0,unfortunately all the one s in table 4c do have however some severe weaknesses that limit their reliability and validity
0,in particular the frr and far may not be satisfactory
0,for instance during may 2002 a japanese group of researchers reported that using fake fingerprints fashioned from gelatin were able to fool biometric fingerprint readers 80 of the time
0,the researchers also devised a way to create fake fingerprints from fingerprints left on glass surfaces
0,what is interesting is that the material needed to make this work was purchased at a neighborhood store and cost less than euro 11
0,this attack is a classic replay or forgery attack
0,unfortunately replays are not unique to fingerprints but are a fundamental vulnerability of all biometrics
0,the american civil liberties union aclu published a report during may 2002 about the inaccuracy of tests using facial recognition technology at the palm beach fl international airport
0,the technology failed to correctly identify faces more than half of the time
0,the recognition rate went down when people wore glasses turned their heads or were moving
0,bluetooth is short range radio that can be stuck on anything including a mobile phone or computer as well a ticket barrier or a trolley full of supermarketgoods
0,in turn users can use the technology to connect various devices e g computer and stereo or pay at the train waving their bluetooth enabled technology e g card or mobile phone to have the fare added to their monthlybill
0,bluetooth was named after a century danish king harald bluetooth
0,the standard was founded by ericsson in 1994 but it was joined by nokia ibm and intel in 1998 to form the bluetooth special interest group thatcampaigns for further bluetooth adoption
0,blue screen of death bsod is a term used in relations to microsoft windows operating systems
0,some crashes of these systems appear as a bluesscreen with white hexadecimal text part of memory dump
0,many usersconsider this a useless information however it can be often used to detectmisbehaving programs often not from microsoft causing these fatal crashes
0,broadband is high speed internet access
0,broadband may be delivered to private households with asymmetrical digital subscriber line adsl digitalsubscriber line dsl cable tv lines fixed wireless access or even satellite supported broadband in more remote areas
0,bulletin board system s bbs are a type of online computer service thatfunctions as an electronic notice board
0,users can read or post messages download programs and play online games
0,some functions of a bbs aresimilar to that of the internet but on a smaller scale
0,business continuity plan bcp is a plan to ensure that the essential business functions of the organization are able to continue or re start in the event of unforeseen circumstances normally a disaster of some sort
0,the bcp follows the disaster recovery plan
0,bcp identifies the critical people and their roles and functions while the bcp is in force information systems and other infrastructures e g telephones servers sms gateways that are required to enable the business to operate again fully
0,the bcp lays out a detailed plan which if called upon should be executed to assure minimum additional disruption after a massive computer virus attack or disaster
0,companies that do not have clear business continuity plans remain very vulnerable
0,good recovery from a disaster is however contingent upon people processes and training
0,finally management awareness may be the main weakness in business continuity planning
0,doing the basics well is they key whereby if one says one will take his or her data off site within 24 hours of a calamity one must make sure that this is being done
0,hence fire drills or dress rehearsals by simulating various disaster scenarios will permit the organization to be in a better position while recovering faster after a disaster
0,hence business continuity and disaster recovery plans need to be exercised so that kinks may be worked out before the crisis hits
0,disk cache is a temporary storage place that a computer can use to storea file after reading it from the hard drive
0,for instance telling a computerto open a mp3 file it may take several seconds for it to locate and read thefile into memory from the pcs hard drive
0,however if the computer storesthe file in the disk cache the next time one wishes to open the same file data can be retrieved from the disk cache rather than loading it from the harddrive
0,one definition refers to a disk cache specifically as hard disk based memory used to store accessed web pages
0,this technique enables the browserload the stored pages from the cache rather than from the network
0,that iswhy clicking the back button on a browser usually retrieves a page nearlyinstantaneously
0,the virtual memory system that comes with microsoft windows is also another example of disk caching to increase performance
0,file cache is used to store the locations of frequently used files for quickreference
0,when open a file that is stored on a hard drive the computer willfirst check for the file name and location in the file cache
0,if it finds thisinformation the computer can jump immediately to the correct place on ahard drive without having to search in the file allocation table a type of tableof contents for a computer s hard drive
0,because read write heads on a harddrive have to physically move across the disk to search for them it takes timefor the computer to search the hard drive for files that is why using the cacheis fasterisps may also be required to pay copyright fees when caching in the nearfuture
0,web cache is closely related to disk caching and occurs between webservers and a client or many clients
0,it watches requests for html pages images and files to come by saving a copy for itself
0,then if there is anotherrequest for the same object it will use the copy that it has instead of askingthe origin server for it again
0,this type of caching may however infringe upon copyrights and publishers and music distributors are trying to find a solution for this problem
0,omputer security incident response team csirt is a service organization that is responsible for receiving reviewing and responding tocomputer security incident reports and activity
0,a csirt usually performs these services for a defined constituency or agroup of stakeholders
0,these could a firm or a g
0,certification authority is a trusted third party clearing house issueing digitalcertificates and digital signatures
0,for firms the certificates include thecorporation s name a serial number and an expiration date
0,a public key isalso enclosed to allow others to decrypt the message
0,the digital signature ofthe certificate issuing authority is also part of this permitting the recipientto verify that the certificate is valid
0,the challenge is that in some countries the government may require thatthe key recovery facilities must be exercised within its national borders
0,for instance how this may affect citizens who have a digital signature todo e government business with their local government when wanting to doa transaction with the eu or ec or another eu member state s agency stillneeds to be addressed
0,will these other governments accept that the krfacility is exercised in denmark instead of for instance france
0,checksum is a mathematical method whereby the individual binary values ofa string of storage locations on a computer s hard drive are summed up andthe total is then retained for future reference
0,on subsequent accesses thesumming procedure is repeated and the total compared to the one derivedpreviously
0,a difference indicates that an element of stored data has changed duringthe intervening period
0,agreement provides a high degree of assurance butnot total assurance that data have not been changed during the interveningperiod
0,a checksum is also used to verify that a network transmission has beensuccessful
0,if the counts agree it is safe to assume that the transmission wascompleted correctly
0,click wrap agreement checks if a user meets certain requirements by clicking on the i agree button the user has agreed to complete terms of use agreement including another confirmation that the user meets certain requirements e g working at an educational institutions or being located in a country theproduct can and may be used
0,to complete the agreement the user mayagain be required to scroll to the bottom of the agreement and click on the iagree icon see also end user license agreement eula jurisdiction
0,this is also sometimes called a shrink wrap agreement whereby rippingoff the shrink wrap around the software implies that the user will take advantage of the software according to the conditions stipulated by the vendor
0,command and conrol warfare c2w is an integrated use of electronicwarfare military deception operations security and also physical destruction
0,these activities are supported by intelligence in order to deny information or degrade or destroy adversary command and control capabilities
0,friendly c2 activities are protected c2w is an application of information operations in military operations and a subset of information warfare
0,hence it can be offensive and defensive raising ethical questions for non militaryapplications if ever used
0,computer metal oxide semiconductor cmos is a section of the rammemory containing important data such as date and time of the computerclock and its configuration settings
0,a battery that is housed on the computermotherboard powers the cmos
0,while a virus can overwrite information onthe cmos it can neither infect nor reside in it
0,confidentiality is the property that data or information is not made availableor disclosed to unauthorized parties e g individuals organizations andprocesses

0,critical infrastructure protection cip tries to coordinate efforts to protectcritical infrastructure that may include but not be limited to informationtechnology and utility grids e g electricity
0,critical infrastructure mayinclude essential services such as telecommunication finance banking foodproduction transport and logistics energy and utilities as well as criticalgovernment services
0,one also should consider that in many countries much of the criticalinfrastructure e g electricity gas distribution and shipping is privatelyowned
0,critical infrastructure protection may also include emergency preparedness
0,its mission is usually to enhance the safety and security of citizens orusers in their physical and cyber environments
0,mandates could be such as to provide a comprehensive approach to protecting critical infrastructure thekey physical and cyber components of the energy and utilities communications services transportation safety and government sectors andto be a government s primary agency for ensuring national civil emergencypreparedness for all types of emergencies
0,critical information infrastructure cii may include the information technology component e g hardware software and data of essential ser 1 vices such as telecommunication finance banking food production trans 1 port and logistics energy and utilities as well as critical government services
0,one also should consider that in many countries much of the cii for essential services such as electricity supply lines are is privately owned
0,cii may be vulnerable to an outside dimension that comes from disruption through natural disasters accidents and mismanagement as well as deliberate attack with criminal intent
0,an inside dimension is safety and system related issues including complexity
0,cyberpunks embody behaviors similar to what we define as crackers andphone phreaks but in addition they use technology to damage destroy orcapitalize on the data they find e g for profit
0,most importantly cyberpunksuse their know how to gain more information which in turn increases theirinfluence power and potential threat upon others information world
0,mostof this activity is done at somebody else s expense by for example breakingand entering into an organization s voice mail system
0,gaining unauthorizedaccess and using it resources and process while not being authorized to doso
0,similar to the things we learned in economics 101 demand and supply ofgoods are related
0,accordingly cyberpunks can be compared to fences innew york who sell stolen merchandise at very attractive prices
0,as longas there is a consumer who is willing to go home with a good deal even ifit is at the expense of the victim whose apartment car was broken into thenthe supply will continue
0,if we stop purchasing from fences supply will drop if cyberpunks find no demand for their illegally acquired information and therefore fail to sell their goods supply will be reduced
0,finally providing individual cyberpunks with five minutes of fame doesfurther reinforce the cool image or status the individual is striving for withinhis or her social group
0,lack of attaining fame status or other benefits e g being on a tv show will also help reduce the supply of cyberpunks
0,cyclic redundancy check crc is a technique used to determine fileintegrity through the generation of a crc algorithm
0,the crc algorithmcalculates the crc of the file in question

0,since then it has become a domestic and international encryption standard and has been used inthousands of applications
0,concerns about its short key length have doggedthe algorithm since the beginning and in 1998 a brute force machine capableof breaking des was built
0,today modifications to des such as triple des ensure that it will remain secure for the foreseeable future
0,demilitarized zone dmz is a separate and shielded or cut off systemfrom the main corporate network containing technical equipment such asthe webpage
0,this further protects the main system from being accessed byexternal parties or via the internetthe term comes from the buffer zone that was set up between north koreaand south korea following their war in the early 1950s
0,a dmz is not a singlesecurity component it signifies a capability
0,within the dmz one can find firewalls choke and access routers and alsofront end and back end servers
0,essentially the dmz provides multi layer filtering and screening to completely block off access to the corporate network and data
0,and even wherea legitimate and authorised external query requests corporate data no directconnection will be permitted from the external client only a back end serverwill issue the request which may require additional authentication fromthe internal corporate network
0,how much data may be accessible from theoutside is also depending on asset values that may be represented by thesedata
0,is considered to take place only when accessto a computer or network resource is intentionally blocked or degraded as aresult of malicious action taken by another user
0,while these attacks coulddamage data directly or permanently they do not have to
0,however theyintentionally compromise the availability of the resources
0,an attacker carriesout a denial of service attack by making a resource inoperative by taking upso much of a shared resource that none of the resource is left for other users or by degraded the resource so that it is less valuable to users
0,those sharedresources are reached through processes and can include other processes shared files disk space percentage of cpu modems etc
0,dos is an attack based on the principles of the tcp three way handshakeexploitation
0,it was very popular in late 1990s
0,flooding system by speciallycrafted packets from one host could disable its networking capabilities andin some cases even force it to reboot
0,majority of the exploitable holes werepatched and this form of attack is nowadays nearly impossible
0,digital certificates is the electronic version of an id card that establishesone s credentials and authenticates a person s connection when performinge commerce or e government transactions
0,to obtain digital certificate an organization or individual must apply toa certifications authority which is responsible for validating and ensuringthe authenticity of requesting organization
0,the certificate will identify thename of the organization a serial number the validity date from to andthe organization s public key where encryption to from that organizationis required
0,in addition the digital certificate will also contain the digital signature ofthe certification authority to allow any recipient to confirm the authenticityof the digital certificate
0,a global standard x
0,509 public key infrastructure for the internet defines the requirements for digital certificates and the major certificate authorities conform to this
0,such standards and the integrity of the certificateauthorities are vital for the establishment of digital trust without whiche commerce will never attain its full potential
0,digital rights management drm sometimes also called digital information management lets a document owner define how recipients can handledocuments in terms of forwarding copying and printing them
0,also allowsthe drm holder to determine expiration dates for those permissions
0,a document owner can also designate sections of a document that only certainpeople can change force the use of revision marks for changes and force theuse of certain formatting and styles
0,microsoft has integrated the same typeof functionality into office excel 2003 and office outlook 2003
0,to enable users to take advantage of drm features in office 2003 windows rights management services rms for windows server 2003 hasto be implemented first on the network
0,rms is based on the extensiblerights markup language xrml which is a method for defining rights andpolicies
0,digital signature uses public key algorithm to generate a digital signature which is a block of data used to create some authentication
0,when a judge sees a digital signature he or she does not knowanything about the signatory s intentions
0,he doesn t know if the personagreed to the document as one being presented with a notarized signature
0,nor do we know if the signatory ever saw the signed document
0,the problemis that while a digital signature authenticates the document up to the point of the signingcomputer it does not authenticate the link between that computer and the individual
0,digital signatures prove mathematically that a secret value known as theprivate key was present in a computer at the time the person s signature wascalculated
0,it is a small step from that inferring that the individual enteredthat key into the computer at the time of signing
0,but it is a much largerstep to assume that the individual actually intended a particular documentto be signed
0,and without a tamperproof computer trusted by the signingindividual one can expect digital signature experts to show up in courtcontesting a lot of digital signatures
0,public key pki is used to verify that the signature was really generatedusing the corresponding private key
0,public keys are often registered witha third party and can be downloaded so the person can check if the key isgenuine
0,see also digital signatures
0,public key infrastructure is needed as a means of generating and managing the encryption keys is required
0,it is the use and management of cryptographic keys a public key and a private key for the secure transmission andauthentication of data across public networks
0,vendor systems do however differ key recovery encryption authorization
0,digital watermark is a unique identifier being part of a digital document
0,the watermark is invisible to the human eye but a computer can analyze the document and extract the hidden data
0,the watermark cannot beremoved
0,the primary use of such marks is to allow different marks to be used whenthe document is copied to different persons and thereby establish an audittrail should there be any leakage of information
0,disaster recovery plan deals with the immediate crisis and tries to securecritical it infrastructure by preventing further spread or continuation of thecrisis such as a computer virus or a denial of service attack
0,the disaster recovery plan is needed to make sure that when the disasterstrucks people are being taken to safety quickly or the further spread of avirus or trojan horse can be prevented
0,also with the help of the businesscontinuity plan systems can go online again immediately if need be or elsewithin the time frame planned and agreed upon beforehand
0,distributed denial of service attack ddos is a distributed version ofdos
0,many hosts are used to send packets to a target host
0,this way the hostis flooded by a high amount of traffic and similar results to dos are achieved
0,administrators should check any systems connected to the internet frequently for the presence of ddos software that could be used to attack othernetworks by following the steps as outlined in table 8
0,moreover unnecessary ports should be closed
0,for instance during august 2003 msblaster took advantage of known vulnerable network ports inwindows ports that should have been closed
0,the domain name system dns is the internet s system for mapping alphabetic names to numeric internet protocol ip addresses like a phone book maps a person s name to a phone number
0,for example when a web address url is typed into a browser a dns query is made to learn an ip address of a web server associated with that name
0,using the www
0,example
0,com url example
0,com is the domain name and www is the hostname
0,dns resolution maps www
0,example
0,com into an ip address such as 192
0,0
0,2
0,1
0,when a user needs to load a webpage a conversion must occur between what a user types into their web browser www
0,example
0,com into an ip address required to locate the www
0,example
0,com site
0,the dns system is an open worldwide network of database name servers that include 13 authoritative name servers that serve the dns root zone level known as root servers
0,a root server also called a dns root nameserver receives a dns query that includes a domain name e g www
0,thousandeyes
0,com and responds by directing that request to a top level domain tld nameserver based on the tld of that domain such as
0,com
0,net and
0,org
0,it directly responds to requests for dns records in the root zone by returning an appropriate list of the authoritative tld name servers for the appropriate tld that can resolve the initial dns lookup request for an ip address of that domain name
0,a dynamic link library dll is a collection of small programs that larger programs can load when needed to complete specific tasks
0,the small program called a dll file contains instructions that help the larger program handle what may not be a core function of the original program
0,an example of those tasks might be communicating with a specific device such as a printer or scanner to process a document
0,dll files that support specific device operations are known as device drivers
0,dll contains bits of code and data like classes and variables or other resources such as images that the larger program can use
0,in addition to being a generic term for dynamic link libraries dynamic link library is also the name of microsoft s version of the shared library concept for windows
0,a shared library can exist in any operating system os
0,e government is the public s efforts to bring dealings with the governmentonline thereby enabling citizens to conduct most of their businesses e g ordering a passport online
0,accordingly while the uk wants every government transaction to be offered online by 2005 denmark has chosen toprovide all of its citizens with digital signatures to enable them to do all theirtransactions online
0,pushing e government initiatives requires satisfactory it security of information data and protection of people s privacy which can be a challenge
0,for instance in 2002 canada s auditor general released a report in which itstated that government sites do not seem to do well as far as privacy and datasecurity are concerned
0,his 2003 report acknowledged some improvementsbut did not yet give e government sites a passing grade
0,quite likely othergovernments may have to improve on this score as well
0,as table 9 suggests putting down a policy about e government and itinitiatives is important
0,the hard work follows thereafter
0,providing everycitizen with a digital signature is a start but without addressing the issuesin table 9 it is unlikely to improve service for citizens
0,accordingly governments will have to learn how to manage the changed relationships withtheir citizens and business thanks to e government
0,also identity theft maybecome an issue thanks to increased use of digital signatures by citizensinteracting with the government
0,email or electronic mail is an electronically transmitted message which arrives as a computer file on a user s pc or the corporation s server
0,originallyconceived as a simple means of sending short messages from one computer toanother the simple mail transfer protocol smtp was introduced withoutsecurity in mind
0,whilst standards have been agreed for the attachment of files to emailmessages be aware that such files can contain malicious code such as a virus
0,email is insecure because message can purport to have been sent from an individual whilst it was sentfrom somebody else possible misrepresentation the from field may have been modified to indicate a sender that is fallacious ordoes not exist because there is no authentication the email can be opened by anyone unlessit is encrypted when sending email the sender has no guarantee that the recipient has receivedit after passing through multiple computer nodes to get to the final destination hence without requesting safe receipt there is little guarantee andemail is not a legal document unless sent using a digital signature but by 2002 eu member states and the usa some states have begun accepting documents withdigital signatures as legally binding documents
0,encryption is the process of conversion of an easily understood format text into another format apparently lacking sense because it is encoded
0,theencrypted text is called ciphertext
0,in the encryption context algorithms use a key to control encryption anddecryption see algorithm two categories are used symmetric or secret key uses the same key for encryption decryption orthe latter key is easily derived from the encryption key
0,asymmetric or public key a different key is used for encrypting and decrypting a message accordingly the decrypting key cannot be derived from theencrypting key
0,see also algorithms tables 11a and 11b
0,a majority of cryptographic products are software rather than hardwarebased
0,moreover many are communications oriented rather than data storageoriented they heavily tend towards secure electronic mail ip security ipsec and virtual private network applications
0,in 1999 a report identified 805 hardware and or software products incorporating cryptography manufactured in 35 countries outside the unitedstates
0,most were manufactured in these countries in that order united kingdom followed by germany canada australia switzerland sweden the netherlands and israel
0,other countries accounted for slightly more than a quarter of the world stotal of encryption products
0,table 11a outlines some of the algorithms thathave been used based on the des standard
0,table 11b outlines the various standards that were submitted for testingand examination
0,these finalists were part of the tests being undertaken toselect the advanced encryption standard aes rijndael
0,nd user license agreement eula is a legally binding contract betweenthe developer or publisher of a software program or application and thepurchaser of that software
0,the purchaser does not own the software but has merely a right to use it in accordance with the license agreement
0,during software installation the eula is usually shown and one is required to accept or refuse the terms
0,in some cases the eula is written on the outside of the packaging withthe breaking of the seal to the cd indicating acceptance of the eula
0,in all cases the eula is the contract which users ignore at their peril and whilst most eulas contain broadly similar clauses and restrictions itis important to confirm these before committing your organization
0,extensive mark up language xml is the first building bloc for a semantic web
0,invisible to the human viewer xml tags can be used to describehow information on a page is structured allowing visiting computers to readand act on it without human invention
0,xml describes data in terms of its content
0,in that respect xml is a markuplanguage that has significant potential for the capture and onward processingof data directly from web pages
0,the real significance of this is that businessto business data transfer is greatly facilitated by xml as neither party needs
0,to write interfaces to each other s systems they merely need to be able toaccept and process xml
0,unlike hyper text mark up language html which is a single predefined language xml is a metalanguage
0,hence it is a language for describing other languages
0,therefore visiting computers need to be familiar with thespecific xml language before then can interpret the web page or document
0,hence a computer can refer to an xml schema located elsewhere on theweb
0,extranet helps the organization to link the outside world such as suppliersand customers with a private intranet
0,while this is similar to the internet access is controlled and restricted to particular groups similar to the intranet
0,accordingly an extranet web server can be accessed by all the participantsinvolved in a project e g various engineers and the firm developing a newproduct but not by anyone else
0,in this example the extranet providesproject management functions for the work in progress and the work teamsinvolved
0,the security is increased however breaches can still occur e g cyberpunk getting hold of a password or access to a server who with apassword is given access to the extranet
0,burden of proof is the necessity or duty of affirmatively proving a factor facts in a dispute
0,hence it is important to provide reliable and validevidence especially if the victimized party e g home user wants to proofthat he or she has suffered damages through a computer virus
0,in turn anorganization requires a systematic approach to develop the costs e g tables2a 2d to arrive at the quantified losses it suffered from
0,false negative occurs when an actual intrusive action happened but thesystem fails to detect it or simply allows it to pass as a non intrusive behavior
0,similarly if a virus was activated by a user action on the pc butthe software failed to detect it a false negative occurred
0,firewall consists of a set of related programs located at a network gateway server
0,a firewall is a combination of hardware and software used toimplement a security policy governing the network traffic between two ormore networks
0,some of that traffic may be under the administrator s control e g organization s networks and some of which may be out of the systemadministrator s control e g the internet
0,firewalls determine whether to block or allow network traffic by lookingat tcp7ip packet headers to determine if these are in accordance with predetermined security policy
0,however a firewall does neither have the capabilityto recognize malicious code malware virus nor any means for preventingits transfer to a target system
0,a firewall usually protects the resources of a private network from usersfrom other networks
0,a network firewall commonly serves as a primary lineof defense against external threats to an organization s computer systems networks and critical information
0,firewalls can also be used to partition anorganization s internal networks reducing the risk from insider attacks
0,there are three types of firewalls pack filter filters the contents of the ip packet header therefore limited tothe source and destination address as well as the tcp udp port number
0,filterdoes not check content of message data circuit filter or circuit level gateway applies packet filtering but verifiesinformation based on tcp or udp packet header information as well
0,hence it can make a better decision if the individual packets form part of a valid tcpsequence
0,creates a handshake and once that takes place passes everythingthrough until the session is ended
0,still it has no knowledge of which user isrequesting access to services andapplication filter uses proxies to apply filter rules based on the data contentand sometimes the user
0,a dedicated program called a proxy or proxy server is used to effect the application filter policy rules
0,commonly used applicationfilter is the web proxy
0,it can be used to restrict the internal or intranet webpages that are published out to the internet
0,firmware often takes the form of a device which is attached to or built into a computer such as a rom chip
0,it performs some software function but isnot a program in the sense of being installed and run from the computer sstorage media
0,hence it is located in the middle of the conceptual continuumbetween hardware and software
0,challenge handshake authentication protocol chap is used to periodically verify the identity of the peer using a 3 way handshake
0,this isdone upon initial link establishment and may be repeated anytime after thelink has been established
0,after the link establishment phase is complete the authenticator sendsa challenge message to the peer which is a random byte sequence as wellas the identifier a randomly generated number
0,the peer responds with avalue calculated using a one way hash function
0,the authenticator checksthe response against its own calculation of the expected hash value
0,if thevalues match the authentication is acknowledged otherwise the connectionshould be terminated
0,chap provides protection against playback attack through the use of anincrementally changing identifier and a variable challenge value
0,the use ofrepeated challenges is intended to limit the time of exposure to any singleattack
0,the authentication can occur between client and server in largerinfrastructures however the administration of keys or passwords can bequite a big effort
0,chap also supports the use of central server that acts as a central certification unit according to such as the remote access dial in user serviceprinciple or is in control of the frequency and timing of the challenges
0,hexadecimal is a numerical system using base 16 as opposed to the usualbase 10
0,hexadecimal is a useful way to express binary computer numbersin which a byte is normally expressed as having 8 bits with 2 hexadecimalcharacters representing eight binary digits aka a byte
0,honeynet is a network of hosts that is specifically designed to be compromised
0,it is further refinement of a honeypot
0,highest security precautionsare taken and such networks are heavily monitored
0,the purpose of suchnetworks is to study hackers behaviors tools motives and possible contrameasures
0,honeypot is a system or host specifically designed to be compromised
0,such a system seems to be attractive to hackers but at the same momentthese are heavily monitored
0,the purpose of such a host is to study attacker sbehavior security tools and possible contra measures
0,host means a computer that communicates across the network e g information system pc or other it hardware
0,but a host can also be a pc information system or other it software or hardware that affords subsistenceor lodgment to an infectious agent under normal conditions
0,some malicious code or viruses pass successive stages in alternatehosts of different systems
0,hyper text mark up language html is a descriptive language used forthe transmission of information graphics sounds and animation between aclient web browser and the web server using http protocol
0,html tags or mark up used in web pages dictate how the informationwill be displayed such as a headline here or italics there
0,however they giveno clue as to the text s meaning
0,hyper text transfer protocol is used for the transmission of information graphics sounds and animation between a client web browser andthe web server
0,it is defined in rfc2616 and updated with rfc2817
0,secure hyper text transfer protocol uses http but additionally activates web server security in the form of secure socket layer ssl
0,this means that the communications between the client and the host webserver are encrypted and additionally that the host web server may be validated by the client using a digital certificate on the server
0,the url for such web sites indicates that they are secure by the use of rather than
0,some may list this term as shttp instead of
0,integrated services digital network isdn allows voice video and datato be transmitted over a single telephone line at speeds depending upon thenetwork provider
0,in the mid 1990s isdn offered speed of up to four timesas fast as conventional 28
0,8 kbps modems up to 128 kilobits per second orkbps
0,there are two basic types of isdn service basic rate interface bri and primary rate interface pri
0,bri consists of two 64 kb s b channelsand one 16 kb s d channel for a total of 144 kb s
0,this basic service isintended to meet the needs of most individual users
0,pri is intended for users with greater capacity requirements
0,typically thechannel structure is 23 b channels plus one 64 kb s d channel for a total of1536 kb s
0,in europe pri consists of 30 b channels plus one 64 kb s d channel fora total of 1984 kb s
0,internet protocol version 6 ipv6 is the next generation protocol designed by the internet engineering task force ietf to replace the currentversion internet protocol ip version 4 ipv4
0,most of today s internet uses ipv4 which is now twenty years old
0,ipv4has been remarkably resilient in spite of its age but it is beginning to haveproblems
0,most importantly there is a growing shortage of ipv4 addresses which are needed by all new machines added to the internet
0,ipv6 fixes a number of problems in ipv4 such as the limited number ofavailable ipv4 addresses
0,it also adds many improvements to ipv4 in areassuch as routing and network autoconfiguration
0,ipv6 is expected to graduallyreplace ipv4 with the two coexisting for a number of years during a transitionperiod
0,internet service provider isp describes a firm that provides access to theinternet plus a range of standard services such as email and the hosting running of personal and corporate web sites
0,isps usually charge a tariff for their services although income can bederived from various sources of advertising and portal activities
0,java applets are java applications with some security related limitationsimposed on them
0,these applets are downloaded to the local computer orpc
0,they run within a java sandbox created by a web browser
0,this limitsthe applet s ability to perform some functions that could be considered risky
0,java applets cannot execute arbitrary system commands write to the local file system outside of strictly designated areas but this is browserdependent andopen network connections to sites other than the one from which the appletoriginated
0,java sandbox contains specific provisions to deal with potentially dangerousapplets and tries to execute them in a protected mode that severely limits theeffects they can have on other applications and the host computer
0,the javadesign team spent time worrying about malicious executables and how theycan be prevented from running amok hence the sandbox was invented
0,javascript is an interpreted scripting language similar in capability tomicrosoft s visual basic or sun microsystems perl scripting language
0,java script is interpreted not compiled and therefore slower to execute thancompiled code
0,it is easier to maintain and fast enough for small applications
0,security risks associated with javascript are generally limited todenial of service dos attacks such as excessive loadon the processor or annoyance attacks
0,keystroke monitoring is audit trail software or a specially designed device recording every key struck by a user and every character of the response thatthe information system returns to the user
0,logic bombs also called fork bombs is a program or portion thereoffthat triggers or causes an application or operating system to perform whena certain logical event occurs
0,the code may be used to recursively spawncopies of itself thereby eventually eating all the process table entries andeffectively locking up the system
0,a specific date key combination or internal counter are some of themost commonly used triggers that produce effects ranging from on screendisplays to the blocking of the system or the deletion of files and programs
0,for instance every day at 17 00 hours it mails out a message to 10 addressesout of a person s email address database
0,a virus may also no longer distribute itself after a certain date
0,for instance the sobig virus family expired september 10 2003 indicating that the writerwas primarily interested in studying the virus effects on networks
0,however this might change in the near future
0,master boot record mbr is the program stored in the boot sector of thebootable media
0,mbr viruses normally enter the system through a floppydisk
0,all floppy disks have a boot sector regardless of whether they arebootable or not
0,if the computer is started with a floppy disk in drive a the operating system reads the information contained in its boot sector andchecks to see if it is bootable
0,if there is a virus in this sector the computerreads this virus code first and therefore the virus is able to infect the computer
0,moore s law is a theorem that states that the amount of information storableon a given amount of silicon has roughly doubled every year since the technology was invented
0,first mentioned in 1964 by semiconductor engineergordon moore co founder of intel in 1968 this held until the late 1970s at which point the doubling period slowed to 18 months
0,some are nowsuggesting that it is taking again 24 30 months
0,open source is code that is put into the public domain
0,hence any usercan take advantage of it usually for free
0,most importantly if the code ispopular many people may examine it and therefore assuring that securitybugs are published quickly
0,very nicely for users fixes are usually availablein relatively short time thereafter
0,operating system are computer programs that that are primarily or entirelyconcerned with controlling the computer and its associated hardware ratherthan with processing work for users
0,computers can operate without application software but they cannot run without an operating system
0,examplesare dos maxos linux and unix
0,parallel processing occurs when a computer uses more than one processor either to be able to perform more than one task at the same time or to improveprocessing speed by breaking down one larger task between different processors
0,parallel processing is not quite the same as multi tasking since by definition a single processor cannot do two things at once
0,it just seemsthat way to the user because the two things are handled one after the otherso very quickly
0,password is usually a string of alphanumeric characters a user will type onhis or her keyboard with lower and or uppercase letters as well and hopefullywithout vocals such as 19mlnmy82
0,ideally a computer or a network hasits own dictionary of common passwords whereby a password previouslyused or included in the dictionary is refused by the system
0,passwords must never ever be written down
0,neither should one useone s first last or a family member s name nor one containing all digits or aword contained in a dictionary
0,below are some additional issues that needto be remembered
0,ubiquitous computing is a term put forward by mark weiser in ubiquitous computing is a term put forward by mark weiser in 1988 describing it as information technology s next wave after the mainframe and pc
0,in this new world what weiser called calm technology will reside around us interacting with users in natural ways to anticipate their needs and supply the information they want wherever they are
0,pervasive computing requires that computing devices are ubiquitious and if not invisible at least handy for users and easy to take wherever one wishes to go e g small cellular used for tracking location of person
0,pervasivecomputing envisions environments richly lathered with computation communication and networked devices mobile users interacting with their environment using speech and vision with secure access to personal or publicdata
0,pervasive computing environments will not simply be standalone vehicles for number crunching rather they will immerse their users in a triad of nvisible computation communication and devices working in concert to satisfy userrequirements according to the facilities available in the environment
0,as such pervasive computing is a world saturated with computing andcommunication on the road to ubiquitous computing
0,the latter also gracefully integrates social and end user issues including but not limited to socialinformatics and social securematics
0,php is an html embedded web scripting language
0,accordingly phpcode can be inserted into the html of a web page
0,when a php page isaccessed the php code is read or parsed by the server the page resides on
0,the output from the php functions on the page are typically returned ashtml code which can be read by the browser
0,because the php code istransformed into html before the page is loaded users cannot view the phpcode on a page
0,this make php pages secure enough to access databases andother secure information
0,a lot of the syntax of php is borrowed from other languages such as c java and perl
0,however php has a number of uniquefeatures and specific functions as well
0,the goal of the language is to allowweb developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly and easily
0,php is also helpful for creating database driven web sites
0,ping stands for packet internet or inter network groper and is a packet small message sent to test the validity availability of an ip address ona network
0,the technical term for ping is the internet control messageprotocol
0,maliciously sending large volumes of pings to cause difficultiesfor anyone else attempting to access that address is known as smurfing
0,port address translation pat is communication technology used byrouters to allow multiple users in a local network to access with their ownip address the internet or corporate networks via a single public address
0,pat actually translates multiple private ip addresses to a single public address or to a public sub network recognized by the ip service provider
0,thisfunction can reduce operating costs increase security and simplify internetaccess
0,if an attacker wants to access ports connected to the 3com officeconnectremote 812 adsl router the router will not allow this connection
0,however firmware versions v1
0,1
0,9 and v1
0,1
0,7 had a confirmed vulnerability that ifa connection is made to a redirected port using pat and then to any portnot redirected using pat the router allows the successive connections to anyport
0,the problem exists with tcp and with udp
0,port scan gives a list of all ports that are actually listening
0,the netstat command can be run locally to determine the open ports but an external port scanagainst the system is usually also needed
0,if the results of netstat differ fromthe port scanning results validation of why each port is open and what isrunning on each port is needed
0,ports that cannot be validated or justifiedshould be closed
0,the final list should be recorded and used to audit the portson a regular basis thereby making sure no extraneous ports appear
0,blocking ports is not a substitute for a comprehensive security solution
0,anattacker may have gained access via other means such as a dial up modem atrojan e mail attachment or a person who is an organization insider
0,hence the attacker can exploit these ports if not properly secured on every hostsystem in the firm
0,pretty good privacy pgp is a software package permitting users to useencryption when exchanging messages widely available
0,export versionsof pgp are different than versions used in the usa and canada
0,protocol is a set of formal rules describing how to transmit data especiallyacross a network
0,low level protocols define the electrical and physicalstandards to be observed bit and byte ordering and the transmission anderror detection and correction of the bit stream
0,high level protocols dealwith the data formatting including the syntax of messages the terminal tocomputer dialogue character sets sequencing of messages etc
0,protocols are therefore a set of rules that define how communications should take place as they are common formulas that enable two separate computers to speak with and understand each other
0,the first group of protocols includes the transmission control protocol internet protocol tcp ip family used for communication via internet
0,other examples are such as http that is used for web page communications being a subset of tcp ip
0,radio frequency identification rfid technology was used by gillette infield tests for tracking packets of razors through its supply chain
0,michelinplans to use vulcanizing to attach an rfid to a tire
0,benetton is another clothing manufacturer that tested rfid tags in someproducts such as by weaving the technology into the collar tags of clothesthat cost at least 15 to keep track of them as they ship
0,benetton pulled backfrom this rfid trial after a consumer group announced a global boycott ofthe clothing manufacturer
0,the advantage of rfids over barcodes is that information can be collectedwithout a line of sight to the tag hence a pallet of goods or a razor can justbe scanned by passing through a radio field
0,with location tracking chips in mobile phones and toll payment cards thetechnology can always provide information about where the product and itsuser are currently located
0,this does not look good for data protection and privacy and consumeradvocacy groups have complained loudly and continue fighting for citizen srights to privacy
0,remote access tools rats enables a person to access a server remotelyby using for instance a telephone modem or wireless access
0,rat candrift in and out of legitimacy according to the prevailing legal climate andthe ensuing degree of nervousness displayed by the legal department
0,nonetheless generally rats are defined as being malicious programsthat run invisibly on host pcs
0,they can permit an intruder remote accessand if successful give him or her also control of the machine or pc
0,theseprograms are usually installed for stealth installation and the programs mayby hidden via a trojan horse that is embedded in a game or another program
0,these are usually small files with a size of between 10 kb 30 kb
0,an attacker may try to hide this program using a so called binder tocombine a rat with legitimate executables thereby enabling the rat toexecute in the background while the legitimate application runs as well thereby keeping the victim unaware of these undesirable activities
0,best known rats are back orifice and subseven that can capture screen sound and video content
0,these trojans are key loggers remote controllers ftp servers and htp servers
0,telnet servers and password finders are alsopart of their capabilities and rats may also rogue mechanisms that hidethe trojans by using encrypted communication
0,worse is if they also containprofessional looking apis thereby making it feasible for other attackers toinsert additional features
0,rijndael algorithm was finally chosen as the winner because it was thefastest of them all
0,the algorithm was broken shortly after its adoption bymike boyle and chris salter as well as by phillip rogaway within daysof its publication as the accepted aes
0,however academic breaks are theones that force you to change things in the design process practical breaksforce you to change things in fielded equipment
0,this work is clearly of theacademic break variety
0,role based access control rbac means that access decisions are basedon the roles the user has as part of tasks to be performed
0,the central notion of rbac is that users do not have discretionary access to enterprise objects
0,instead access permissions are administrativelyassociated with roles and users are administratively made members of appropriate roles
0,this idea greatly simplifies management of authorizationwhile providing an opportunity for great flexibility in specifying and enforcing enterprise specific protection policies
0,users can be made members ofroles as determined by their responsibilities and qualifications and can beeasily reassigned from one role to another without modifying the underlyingaccess structure
0,roles can be granted new permissions as new applicationsand actions are incorporated and permissions can be revoked from roles asneeded
0,router is an interconnection device similar to a bridge but serves packets orframes containing certain protocols
0,hence routers link local area networks lans at the network layer
0,but with home users installing their own routers denial of serive attacks can become a nightmare
0,for instance in may 2003 the universityof wisconsin madison found that it was the recipient of a continuous largescale flood of inbound internet traffic destined for one of the campus publicnetwork time protocol ntp servers
0,the flood traffic rate was hundredsof thousands of packets per second and hundreds of megabits per second
0,the only recourse available to the university was to go to its isp andasking it to null route all this traffic to the university servers meanwhilepaying a huge increase in bandwidth costs an increase that seriously hurtthe university s it budget and would have quickly depleted it they isp didnot respond by null routing the traffic
0,script kiddie is a derogatory term used by real hackers and security professionals for less skilled hackers
0,these hackers usually use scripts and toolsfrom internet without appropriate knowledge
0,they often target unix hostswith tools that are for targeting of ms windows hosts and vice versa
0,it hasbeen observed that these hackers are not having much knowledge and evensimple system commands may pose a significant challenge to them
0,unfortunately these types of hackers can cause as much harm as real hackerscan
0,sector means pie shaped slices and track that are concentric rings on a disk
0,a combination of two or more sections on a single track makes a clusteror block the minimum unit used to store information
0,the number of sectorsper track determines the size of each cluster
0,in turn the number of clusterson a disk s surface decides the storage capacity of the disk
0,the sector is the smallest unit that can be accessed on a disk and it has asize of 512 bytes
0,secure hash a process which reduces a message of arbitrary length to afixed length fingerprint which is very unlikely to be the same for any othermessage
0,the word secure indicates that the algorithm has been chosen sothat it is not possible to forge a message which to have given hash value norto create two similar messages with the same hash value
0,secure socket layer ssl means that the communications between theclient and the host web server are encrypted and additionally that the hostweb server may be validated by the client using a digital certificate on theserver
0,ssl is a protocol developedby netscape
0,the most common application of ssl is for ssl encrypted
0,nowadays many other protocols use advantages of ssl such as pop smtp and nntp
0,signature based intrusion detection systems are matching collected dataagainst known set of signatures of known attacks
0,this means that thesesystems are only as good as their patter finger print signature database
0,these databases have to be continuously updated and maintained to assure their currency
0,this is a tedious task and there are recently attemptsto create central repository and unified descriptive language for thesesystems
0,smurfing is an attack that exploits features of the ip protocol within thetcp ip protocol used for internet communications
0,a smurf attack causes a victim s computer to become completely waylaid with answering fictitious network requests pings that it grinds to ahalt and prevents anyone else from logging on
0,sniffer is software designed to look at and or to collect traffic on the wire
0,sniffing tools are built into majority of unix type systems and there is wealthof free tools available on the internet for other platforms
0,majority of themare designed around the libpcap library and tcpdump tool
0,some intrusiondetection systems have option of being run as a sniffer too
0,social engineering is a technique where persuasion and or deception are usedto gain access to the systems
0,this is typically implemented through humanconversation or other interaction
0,typical example of this is an attack wherea hacker pretends to be a high positioned it executive traveling on companybusiness and having problems to connect to the organization s informationsystem through its remote access point
0,the person may gradually succeed in persuading the help desk operatorto tell him or her all the necessary details for the connection set up
0,later onattacker calls again complaining that his password for some reason does notwork and persuades the help desk to change it to a password of her or hisliking
0,hence the person may gain unauthorized access
0,the term can also be applied to exploiting the victim s good intentions andlack of in depth technical knowledge in order to inspire fear and confusion
0,this process is often considered in the context of memetics which dealswith the transfer of memes the unit of cultural inheritance from brain tobrain
0,where social engineering is linked to an it security issue or hoax it nearlyalways trades on technophobia
0,p2p spoofing means that an attacker could have anonymously tricked aninnocent p2p user into downloading a contraband file from another user onthe p2p network
0,this can occur by having an attacker modify search requestsand search results in transit by for instance placing the innocent user s ipaddress in the search result packet that lists a contraband file
0,another waymight be whereby a search request for music has a hop count set to 255
0,theflawed p2p application permits the attacker to set the hop count value backto zero thereby making the innocent user be seen as the originator
0,changingthe search string church hymns to rolling stones makes an authority assumethat the innocent user went out to search for illegal content
0,the difficulties for authorities is to prove that the apparent offender wasthe actual offender in turn this would require that the agency proofs that therewere no malicious users on the p2p network at the time while the apparentoffender s p2p application had no implementation flaws that are possible
0,steganography hidden writing is a form of data hiding
0,unlike cryptography which creates an unreadable version of a message for anyone withoutthe key steganography conceals even the existence of secret messages
0,oneof the earliest forms of steganography is spread spectrum radio transmissions in which parts of a message even parts of individual bits are senton pseudo randomly varying radio frequencies without the right equipment the signal is merely electronic white noise
0,steganography circumvents restrictions on encryption and preventssigint signals intelligence personnel from detecting encrypted traffic
0,digital watermarks and copy protection schemes are forms of steganography used to reduce the ease of illegal copying of intellectual property and totrace the origin of files
0,there are many tools available for embedding secret messages in otherfiles for instance mp3stego modifies mp3 audio files to hold messages
0,steganalysis tools look for tell tale patterns in changed data when lookingfor concealed messages
0,stream cipher encrypts in small units often a bit or a byte at a time
0,unlike abasic block cipher a stream cipher will have output corresponding to a giveninput will depend on where in the message it occurs
0,the simplest type ofstream cipher uses a complicated function which retains state to generatea pseudo random sequence which is then combined with the input using asimple operation such as bytewise addition
0,just as the way business is organized and conducted has been profoundly changed by information and communications technology the operation of government at all levels has been similarly affected
0,the term e government or electronic government is a way of looking at these changes as a whole and of considering how government uses or might use various computer applications
0,the use of information technology in government can involve changes in the organization and internal communications of government departments changes in how services are delivered to the public and providing new ways for the public to interact with the agency
0,internally government agencies have many of the same information management and sharing needs as private enterprises
0,however government agencies are likely to have to adapt their information systems to account for complex specialized regulations both those the agency administers and others it is subject to
0,the standards of openness and accountability are generally different from and stricter than those that apply to private organizations
0,eiffel is an interesting programming language developed by bertrand meyer and his company eiffel software in the 1980s
0,the language was named for gustav eiffel the architect who designed the famous tower in paris
0,the language and accompanying methodology attracted considerable interest at software engineering conferences
0,eiffel fully supports and in some ways pioneered programming concepts found in more widely used languages today
0,syntactically eiffel emphasizes simple reusable declarations that make the program easier to understand and tries to avoid obscure or lower level code such as compiler optimizations
0,eiffel s proponents note that it is more than a language it is designed to provide consistent ways to revise and reuse program components throughout the software development cycle
0,the current implementation of eiffel is available for virtually all platforms and has interfaces to c c and other languages
0,this allows eiffel to be used to create a design framework for reusing existing software components in other languages
0,eiffel s consistent object oriented design also makes it useful for documenting or modeling software projects
0,there are a variety of ways to electronically register store and process votes
0,in recent years older manual systems paper ballots or mechanical voting machines have been replaced in many areas with systems ranging from purely digital touch screens to hybrid systems where marked paper ballots are scanned and tabulated by machine
0,however voting systems have been subject to considerable controversy particularly following the florida debacle in the 2000 u s presidential election
0,the criteria by which voting systems are evaluated include how easy it is for the voter to understand and use the system accessibility for disabled persons whether the voter s intentions are accurately recorded the ability to make a permanent record of the vote prevention of tampering physical or electronic provisions for independent auditing of the votes in case of disputethe degree to which a given system meets these criteria can vary considerably because of both design and implementation issues
0,the earliest form of voting system consisted of paper ballots marked and tabulated entirely by hand
0,the first generation of automatic voting systems involved mechanical voting machines where votes were registered by pulling levers
0,next came two types of hybrid systems where votes were cast mechanically but tabulated automatically
0,these systems used punch cards or marksense or similar systems where the voter filled in little squares and the ballots were then scanned and tabulated automatically
0,the ultraclose and highly disputed 2000 u s presidential election stress tested voting systems that most people had previously believed were reasonably accurate
0,the principal problems were the interpretation of punch cards that were not properly punched through so called dimpled or hanging chads and the fact that some ballot layouts proved to be confusing or ambiguous
0,two types of voting systems have been proposed as replacements for the problematic earlier technology
0,this type of system uses a screen display that can be directly manipulated by the voter
0,in the most common type called dre direct recording electronic a computer program interprets and tabulates the vote as it is cast storing an image in a removable memory unit and usually printing out a copy for backup
0,after voting is complete the memory module can be sent to the central counting office
0,alternatively votes can be transmitted over a computer network in batches throughout the day
0,in a few cases voting has also been implemented through secure internet sites
0,concern about potential tampering with computers has led many jurisdictions to begin to replace touchscreen systems with optical scan systems where the voter marks a sturdy paper ballot
0,about half of u s counties now use optical scan systems
0,the advantage of optical systems is that the voter physically marks the ballot and can see how he or she has voted and after tabulation the physical ballots are available for review in case of problems
0,however optical scan ballots must be properly marked using the correct type of pencil or they may not be read correctly
0,unlike the touchscreen it is not possible to give the voter immediate feedback so that any errors can be corrected
0,optical ballot systems may cost more because of paper and printing costs for the ballots which may have to be prepared in several languages
0,however this cost may be offset by not having to develop or validate the more complicated software needed for all electronic systems
0,electronic mail is perhaps the most ubiquitous computer application in use today
0,e mail can be defined as the sending of a message to one or more individuals via a computer system open the file and look for messages
0,in 1971 however the arpanet ancestor of the internet see internet was used by researchers at bolt beranek and newman bbn to send messages from a user at one computer to a user at another
0,the availability of e mail helped fuel the growth of the arpanet through the 1970s and beyond
0,connection
0,development and architecturethe simplest form of e mail began in the 1960s as a way that users on a time sharing computer system could post and read messages
0,the messages consisted of text in a file that was accessible to all users
0,a user could simply log into the
0,when people think of a computer they generally think of a general purpose computing system housed in a separate box for use on the desk or as a laptop or hand held device
0,however the personal computer and its cousins are only the surface of a hidden web of computing capability that reaches deep into numerous devices used in our daily lives
0,modern cars for example often contain several specialized computer systems that monitor fuel injection or enhance the car s grip on the road under changing conditions
0,many kitchen appliances such as microwaves dishwashers and even toasters contain their own computer chips
0,communications systems ranging from cell phones to tv satellite dishes include embedded computers
0,most important embedded systems are now essential to the operation of critical infrastructure such as medical monitoring systems and power transmission networks
0,the potential vulnerability of embedded systems to the y2k date related problems was a major concern in the months leading up to 2000 especially because many embedded systems might have to be replaced rather than just reprogrammed
0,in the event it turned out that there were relatively few date dependent systems and only minor disruptions were experienced
0,one consequence of the universal computer concept is that in principle any computer can be programmed to imitate the operation of any other
0,an emulator is a program that runs on one computer but accurately processes instructions written for another
0,for example fans of older computer games can now download emulation programs that allow modern pcs to run games originally intended for an apple ii microcomputer or an atari game machine
0,emulators allowing macintosh and linux users to run windows programs have also achieved some success
0,in order to work properly the emulator must set up a sort of virtual model of the target microprocessor including appropriate registers to hold data and instructions and a suitably organized segment of memory
0,while carrying out instructions in software rather than in hardware imposes a considerable speed penalty if the processor of the emulating pc is much faster than the one being emulated the emulator can actually run faster than the original machine
0,in the earliest programming languages any part of a program could access any other part simply by executing an instruction such as jump or goto
0,later the concept of the subroutine helped impose some order by creating relatively self contained routines that could be called from the main program
0,at the time the subroutine is called it is provided with necessary data in the form of global variables or preferably parameters which are variable references or values passed explicitly when the subroutine is called
0,when the subroutine finishes processing it may return values by changing global variables or changing the values of variables that were passed as parameters
0,the use of encryption to disguise the meanings of messages goes back thousands of years the romans for example used substitution ciphers where each letter in a message was replaced with a different letter
0,mechanical cipher machines first came into general use in the 1930s
0,during world war ii the german enigma cipher machine used multiple rotors and a configurable plugboard to create a continuously varying cipher that was thought to be unbreakable
0,however allied codebreakers built electromechanical and electronic devices that succeeded in exploiting flaws in the german machine while incidentally advancing computing technology
0,during the cold war western and soviet cryptographers vied to create increasingly complex cryptosystems while deploying more powerful computers to decrypt their opponent s messages
0,this concept refers to the organization of data processing and communications across an entire corporation or other organization
0,historically computing technology and infrastructure often developed at different rates in the various departments of a corporation
0,for example by the 1970s departments such as payroll and accounting were making heavy use of electronic data processing edp using mainframe computers
0,the introduction of the desktop computer in the 1980s often resulted in operations such as marketing corporate communications and planning being conducted using a disparate assortment of software databases and document repositories
0,even the growing use of networking often meant that an enterprise had several different networks with at best rudimentary intercommunication
0,much publicity has been given to figures such as microsoft founder and multibillionaire bill gates who turned a vest pocket company selling basic language tapes into the dominant seller of operating systems and office software for pcs
0,historically however the role of key entrepreneurs in the establishment of information technology sectors repeats the achievements of such 19th and early 20th century technology pioneers as thomas edison and henry ford
0,there appear to be certain times when scientific insight and technological capability can be translated into businesses that have the potential to transform society while making the pioneers wealthy
0,ergonomics is the study of the fit between people and their working environment
0,because computers are such a significant part of the working life of so many people finding ways for people to maximize efficiency and reduce health risks associated with computer use is increasingly important
0,since the user will be looking at the computer monitor for hours on end it is important that the display be large enough to be comfortably readable and that there be enough contrast
0,glare on the monitor surface should be avoided
0,it is recommended that the monitor be placed so that the top line of text is slightly below eye level
0,a distance of about 18 inches to two feet roughly arm s length is recommended
0,there has been concern about the health effects of electromagnetic radiation generated by monitors
0,most new monitors are designed to have lower emissions
0,transmitting data involves the sending of bits ones and zeros as signaled by some alternation in physical characteristics such as voltage or frequency
0,there are a number of ways in which errors can be introduced into the data stream
0,for example electrical noise in the line might be interpreted as spurious bits or a bit might be flipped from one to zero or vice versa
0,generally speaking the faster the rates at which bits are being sent the more sensitive the transmission is to effects that can cause errors
0,while a few wrong characters might be tolerated in some text messages or graphics files binary files representing executable programs must generally be received perfectly since random changes can make programs fail or produce incorrect results
0,data communications engineers have devised a number of methods for checking the accuracy of data transmissions
0,an important characteristic of quality software is its ability to handle errors that arise in processing also called run time errors or exceptions
0,before it is released for general use a program should be thoroughly tested with a variety of input
0,when errors are found the soundness of the algorithm and its implementation must be checked as well as the program logic
0,interaction between the program and other programs including the operating system as well as with hardware must also be considered
0,see bugsand debugging
0,however even well tested software is likely to encounter errors
0,therefore a program intended for widespread use must include instructions for dealing with errors anticipated or otherwise
0,the process of error handling can be divided into four stages validation detection communication and amelioration
0,an expert system is a computer program that uses encoded knowledge and rules of reasoning to draw conclusions or solve problems
0,since reasoning as opposed to mechanical calculation is a form of intelligent behavior the field of expert systems also called knowledge representation or knowledge engineering is part of the broader field of ai
0,an expert system has two main components a knowledge baseand an inference engine
0,the knowledge base consists of a set of assertions facts or of rules expressed as if
0,then statements that specify conditions that if true allow a particular inference to be drawn
0,the inference engine accepts new assertions or queries and tests them against the stored rules
0,because satisfying one rule can create a condition that is to be tested by a subsequent rule chains of reasoning can be built up
0,if the reasoning is from initial facts to an ultimate conclusion it is called forward chaining
0,if a conclusion is given and the goal is to prove that conclusion there can be backward chaining from the conclusion to the assertions
0,today the term data is associated in many peoples minds mainly with computers
0,however data as in given facts or measurements has been used as a term by scientists and scholars for centuries
0,just as with a counting bead a notch in a stick or a handwritten tally data as stored in a computer or on digital media is a representation of facts about the world
0,these facts might be temperature readings customer addresses dots in an image the characteristics of a sound at a given instant or any number of other things
0,but because computer data is not a fact but a representation of facts its accuracy and usefulness depends not only on the accuracy of the original data but on its context in the computer
0,abstract data types are used to describe a generic type of data specifying how the data is stored and what operations can be performed on it
0,dfor example an abstract stack data type includes a structure for storing data such as a list or array and a set of operations such as pushing an integer onto the stack and popping removing an integer from the stack
0,for the process of combining data and operations into a single entity see encapsulation
0,abstract data types can be implemented directly in object oriented programming languages
0,one advantage of using abstract data types is that it separates a structure and functionality from its implementation
0,in designing the abstract stack type for example one can focus on what a stack does and its essential functions
0,one avoids becoming immediately bogged down with details such as what sorts of data items can be placed on the stack or exactly what mechanism will be used to keep track of the number of items currently stored
0,this approach also avoids featuritis the tendency to see how many possible functions or features one can add to the stack object
0,for example while it might be useful to give a stack the ability to print out a list of its items it is probably better to wait until one needs such a capability than to burden the basic stack idea with extra baggage that may make it more cumbersome or less efficient
0,an abstract data type or its embodiment
0,there are a variety of ways in which data facts or measurements about the world can be turned into a digital representation suitable for manipulation by a computer
0,for example pressing a key on the keyboard sends a signal that is stored in a memory buffer using a value that represents the ascii character code for the key pressed
0,moving the mouse sends a stream of signals that are proportional to the rotation of the ball which in turn is calibrated into a series of coordinates and ultimately to a position on the screen where the cursor is to be moved
0,digital cameras and scanners convert the varying light levels of what they see into a digital image
0,the data acquisition system begins with a transducer which is a device that converts a physical phenomenon such as heat into a proportional electrical signal
0,transducers include devices such as thermistors thermocouples and pressure or strain gauges
0,the output of the transducer is then fed into a signal conditioning circuit
0,the purpose of signal conditioning is to make sure the signal fits into the range needed by the data processing device
0,thus the signal may be amplified or its voltage may be adjusted or scaled to the required level
0,another function of signal conditioning is to isolate the incoming signal from the computer to which the acquisition device is connected
0,this is necessary both to protect the delicate computer circuits from possible spikes in the incoming signal and to prevent noise extraneous electromagnetic signals created by the computer itself from distorting the signal and thus the ultimate measurements
0,various sorts of filters can be added for this purpose
0,data acquisition systems are essential to gathering and processing the detailed data required by scientific and engineering applications
0,the automated control of chemical or biochemical processes requires the ability of the control software to assess real time physical data in order to make timely adjustments to such factors as temperature pressure and the presence of catalysts inhibitors or other components of the process
0,the highly automated systems used in modern aviation and increasingly even in ground vehicles depend on real time data acquisition
0,it is not surprising then that data acquisition is one of the fastest growing fields in computing
0,database administration is the management of database systems
0,database administration can be divided into four broad areas data security data integrity data accessibility and system development
0,with regard to databases ensuring data security includes the assignment and control of users level of access to sensitive data and the use of monitoring tools to detect compromise diversion or unauthorized changes to database files
0,when data is proprietary licensing agreements with both database vendors and content providers may also need to be enforced
0,data integrity is related to data security since the completeness and accuracy of data that has been compromised can no longer be guaranteed
0,however data integrity also requires the development and testing of procedures for the entry and verification of data input as well as verifying the accuracy of reports output
0,database administrators may do some programming but generally work with the programming staff in maintaining data integrity
0,since most data in computers ultimately comes from human beings the training of operators is also important
0,within the database structure itself the links between data fields must be maintained referential integrity and a locking system must be employed to ensure that a new update is not processed while a pending one is incomplete
0,internal procedures and external regulations may require that a database be periodically audited for accuracy
0,while this may be the province of a specially trained information processing auditor it is often added to the duties of the database administrator
0,accessibility has two aspects
0,first the system must be reliable
0,data must be available whenever needed by the organization and in many applications such as e commerce this means 24 hours a day 7 days a week 24 7
0,reliability requires making the system as robust as possible such as by mirroring the database on multiple servers which in turn requires making sure updates are stored concurrently
0,failure must also be planned for which means the imple 130
0,
0,database administrationmentation of onsite and offsite backups and procedures for restoring data
0,a database management system consists of a database a collection of information usually organized into records with component fields and facilities for adding updating retrieving manipulating and reporting on data
0,broadly speaking data communications is the transfer of data between computers and their users
0,at its most abstract level data communications requires two or more computers a device to turn data into electronic signals and back again and a transmission medium
0,telephone lines fiber optic cable network ethernet cable video cable radio wireless or other kinds of links can be used
0,finally there must be software that can manage the flow of data
0,data communications are the basis both for networks and for the proper functioning of servers that provide services such as world wide web pages electronic mail online databases and multimedia content such as audio and streaming video
0,while web page design and e commerce are the bright lights that give cyberspace its character data communications are like the plumbing without which computers cannot work together
0,the growing demand for data communications particularly broadband services such as dsl and cable modems translates into a steady demand for engineers and technicians specializing in the maintenance and growth of this infrastructure
0,the process of removing redundant information from data so that it takes up less space is called data compression
0,besides saving disk space compressing data such as e mail attachments can make data communications faster
0,compression methods generally begin with the realization that not all characters are found in equal numbers in text
0,for example in english letters such as e and s are found much more frequently than letters such as j or x
0,by assigning the shortest bit codes to the most common characters and the longer codes to the least common characters the number of bits needed to encode the text can be minimized
0,the developer of each application program that writes data files must define a format for the data
0,the format must be able to preserve all the features that are supported by the program
0,for example a word processing program will include special codes for font selection typestyles such as bold or italic margin settings and so on
0,in most markets there are more than one vendor so there is the potential for users to encounter the need to convert files such as word processing documents from one vendor s format to another
0,for example a microsoft word user needing to send a document to a user who has wordperfect or the user may encounter another user who also has microsoft word but a later version
0,a modern enterprise database system can contain hundreds of separate data items each with important characteristics such as field types and lengths rules for validating the data and links to various databases that use that item
0,there can also be many different views or ways of organizing subsets of the data and stored procedures program code modules used to perform various data processing functions
0,a developer who is creating or modifying applications that deal with such a vast database will often need to check on the relationships between data elements views procedures and other aspects of the system
0,the process of analyzing existing databases in order to find useful information is called data mining
0,generally a database whether scientific or commercial is designed for a data mining
0,
0,135particular purpose such as recording scientific observations or keeping track of customers account histories
0,however data often has potential applications beyond those conceived by its collector
0,a data structure is a way of organizing data for use in a computer program
0,there are three basic components to a data structure a set of suitable basic data types a way to organize or relate these data items to one another and a set of operations or ways to manipulate the data
0,for example the array is a data structure that can consist of just about any of the basic data types although all data must be of the same type
0,the way the data is organized is by storing it in sequentially addressable locations
0,the operations include storing a data item element in the array and retrieving a data item from the array
0,the data structures commonly used in computer science include arrays as discussed above and various types of lists
0,the primary difference between an array and a list is that an array has no internal links between its elements data structures
0,
0,137while a list has one or more pointers that link the elements
0,there are several types of specialized list
0,a tree is a list that has a root an element with no predecessor and each other element has a unique predecessor
0,the guarantee of a unique path to each tree node can make the operations of inserting or deleting an item faster
0,a stack is a list that is accessible only at the top or front
0,any new item is inserted pushed on top of the last item and removing popping an item always removes the item that was last inserted
0,this order of access is called lifo last in first out
0,a list can also be organized in a first in first out fifo order
0,this type of list is called a queue and is useful in a situation where tasks must wait their turn for attention
0,the preceding data types all hold single values
0,however most modern languages allow for the construction of data types that can hold more than one piece of data
0,the arrayis the most basic structured data type it represents a series of memory locations that hold data of one of the basic types
0,thus in pascal an array of integer holds integers each taking up two bytes of memory
0,many languages have composite data types that can hold data of several different basic types
0,for example the struct in c or the record in pascal can hold data such as a person s first and last name three lines of address all arrays of characters or strings an employee number perhaps an integer or double a boolean field representing the presence or absence of some status and so on
0,this kind of data type is also called a user defined data type because programmers can define and use these types in almost the same ways as they use the language s built in basic types
0,what is the difference between data types and data structures
0,there is no hard and fast distinction
0,generally data structures such as lists stacks queues and trees are more complex than simple data types because they include data relationships and special functions such as pushing or popping data on a stack
0,however a list is the fundamental data type in list processing languages such as lisp and string operators are built into languages such as snobol
0,see list processing stack queue and tree
0,further in many modern languages fundamental and structured data types are combined seamlessly into classes that combine data structures with the relevant operations
0,data warehousemodern business organizations create and store a tremendous amount of data in the form of transactions that become database records
0,increasingly however businesses are relying on their ability to use data that was collected for one purpose such as sales customer service and inventory for purposes of marketing research planning or decision support
0,for example transaction data might be revisited with a view to identifying the common characteristics of the firm s best customers or determining the best way to market a particular type of product
0,in order to conduct such research or analysis the data collected in the course of business must be stored in such a way that it is both accurate and flexible in terms of the number of different ways in which it can be queried
0,the idea of the data warehouse is to provide such a repository for data
0,a decision support system dss is a computer application that focuses on providing access to or analysis of the key information needed to make decisions particularly in business
0,it can be thought of as a more narrowly focused approach to computer assistance to management see management information system
0,the development of dss has several roots reaching back to the 1950s
0,this includes operational analysis and the theory of organizations and the development of the first interactive rather than batch processing computer systems
0,indeed the sage automated air defense system developed starting in the 1950s could be described as a military dss
0,the system presented real time information radar plots and enabled the operator to select and focus on particular elements using a light pen
0,by the 1960s more systematic research on dss was underway and included the provocative idea of human computer symbiosis for problem solving
0,dell computer nasdaq dell is one of the world s leading manufacturers and sellers of desktop and laptop computers
0,by 2008 dell had more than 88 000 employees worldwide
0,the company was founded by michael dell a student at the university of texas at austin whose first company was pc s limited founded in 1984
0,even at this early stage dell successfully employed several practices that would come to typify the dell strategy sell directly to customers not through stores build each machine to suit the customer s preferences and be aggressive in competing on price
0,in 1988 the growing company changed its name to dell computer corporation
0,in the early 1990s dell tried an alternative business model selling through warehouse clubs and computer superstores
0,when that met with little success dell returned to the original formula
0,in 1999 dell overtook compaq to become the biggest computer retailer in america
0,the unusual computing term demon sometimes spelled daemon refers to a process program that runs in the background checking for and responding to certain events
0,the utility of this concept is that it allows for automation of information processing without requiring that an operator initiate or manage the process
0,for example a print spooler demon looks for jobs that are queued for printing and deals with the negotiations necessary to maintain the flow of data to that device
0,another demon called chron in unix systems reads a file describing processes that are designated to run at particular dates or times
0,for example it may launch a backup utility every morning at 1 00 a m e mail also depends on the periodic operation of mailer demons
0,
0,design patterns are an attempt to abstract and generalize what is learned in solving one problem so that it can be applied to future similar problems
0,the idea was first applied to architecture by christopher alexander in his book a pattern language
0,alexander described a pattern as a description of situations in which a particular problem occurs with a solution that takes into account the factors that are invariant not changed by context
0,guidance for applying the solution is also provided
0,for example a bus stop a waiting room and a line at a theme park are all places where people wait
0,a place to wait pattern would specify the problem to be solved how to make waiting as pleasant as possible and suggest solutions
0,patterns can have different levels of abstraction or scales on which they apply for example an intimate theater and a stadium are both places of entertainment but one is much larger than the other
0,patterns in turn are linked into a network called a pattern language
0,thus when working with one pattern the designer is guided to consider related patterns
0,for example a pattern for a room might relate to patterns for seating or grouping the occupants
0,the concept of patterns and pattern languages carries over well into software design
0,as with architectural patterns a software pattern describes a problem and solution along with relevant structures
0,note that patterns are not executable code they are at a higher level one might say abstract enough to be generalizable specific enough to be applicable
0,software patterns can specify how objects are created and ways in which they function and interface with other objects
0,patterns are generally documented using a common format
0,traditionally documents such as advertisements brochures and reports were prepared by combining typed or printed text with pasted in illustrations such as photographs and diagrams
0,this painstaking layout process was necessary in order to produce camera ready copy from which a printing company could produce the final product
0,starting in the late 1980s desktop computers became powerful enough to run software that could be used to create page layouts
0,in addition display hardware gained a high enough resolution to allow for pages to be shown on the screen in much the same form as they would appear on the printed page
0,this is known by the acronym wysiwyg or what you see is what you get
0,the final ingredient for the creation of desktop publishing was the advent of affordable laser or inkjet printers that could print near print quality text and high resolution graphics
0,a fundamental problem in computer design is the control of devices such as disk drives and printers
0,each device is designed to respond to a particular set of control commands sent as patterns of binary values through the port to which the device is connected
0,for example a printer will respond to a new page command by skipping lines to the end of the current page and moving the print head to the start of the next page taking margin settings into account
0,the problem is this when an applications program such as a word processor needs to print a document how should the necessary commands be provided to the printer
0,if every application program has to include the appropriate set of commands for each device that might be in use programs will be bloated and much development effort will be required for supporting devices rather than extending the functionality of the product itself
0,instead the manufacturers of printers and other devices such as scanners and graphics tablets typically provide a program called a driver
0,a version of the driver is created for each major operating system in use
0,the driver serves as the intermediary between the application the operating system and the low level device control system
0,it is sometimes useful to have drivers in the form of continually running programs that monitor the status of a device and wait for commands
0,also called digital money or e cash digital cash represents the attempt to create a method of payment for online transactions that is as easy to use as the familiar bills and coins in daily commerce
0,at present credit cards are the principal means of making online payments
0,while using credit cards takes advantage of a well established infrastructure it has some disadvantages
0,from a security standpoint each payment potentially exposes the payer to the possibility that the credit card number and possibly other identifying information will be diverted and used for fraudulent transactions and identity theft
0,while the use of secure encrypted online sites has reduced this risk it cannot be eliminated entirely
0,credit cards are also impracticable for very small payments from cents to a few dollars such as for access to magazine articles because the fees charged by the credit card companies would be too high in relation to the value of the transaction
0,the concept of digital convergence is an attempt to explore the implications of so many formerly disparate analog media now being available in digital form
0,all forms of digital media have key features in common
0,first they are essentially pure information computer data
0,this means that regardless of whether the data originally represented still images from a camera video or film the sound of a human voice music or some other form of expression that data can be stored manipulated and retrieved under the control of computer algorithms
0,this makes it easier to create seamless multimedia presentations
0,services or products previously considered to be separate can be combined in new ways
0,the dashboard of a car is designed to present vital real time information to the driver such as speed fuel supply and engine status
0,ideally this information should be easy to grasp at a glance allowing for prompt action when necessary
0,conversely unnecessary and potentially distracting information should be avoided or at least relegated to an unobtrusive secondary display
0,a digital dashboard is a computer display that uses similar concepts
0,its goal is to provide an executive or manager with the key information that allows him or her to monitor the health of the enterprise and to take action when necessary
0,a digital dashboard can also be part of a larger set of management tools see decision support system
0,the term digital divide was coined in the late 1990s amid growing concern that groups such as minorities the elderly and rural residents were not becoming computer literate and connecting to the internet at the same rate as the young educated and relatively affluent
0,nearly a decade later this perception of a chasm has diminished somewhat
0,according to the pew internet american life project as of 2006 about two thirds 70 per 148
0,
0,digital dashboardcent of american adults were using the internet and the number has continued to increase though more slowly there is evidence of a hard core unconnected population
0,groups that lagged in internet usage included americans 65 years or older 35 percent african americans 58 percent and persons without at least a high school education 36 percent
0,by default once information is digitized it is simply a pattern of bits that can be easily copied within the same or a different medium using a variety of software or the built in facilities of the operating system
0,of course the development of tape recording technology in the mid 20th century already made it possible to copy audio recordings and the later development of videotape and the vcr did the same for video
0,however while analog copying techniques lose some accuracy or fidelity with each generation of copying digital files can be copied exactly each time
0,it is equally easy to e mail upload or otherwise distribute audio or video files
0,legally the creator of an original work can assert copyright literally the right to copy or to control when and how the work is distributed
0,digital rights management drm refers to a variety of technologies that can be used to enforce this right by making it at least difficult for the purchaser of one copy of a work to copy and distribute it in turn
0,similar technologies have also been used to prevent copying of software which is after all just another pattern of bits see copy protection and software piracy andcounterfeiting
0,this concept involves the creation of a software system that runs programs and stores data across a number of different computers an idea pervasive today
0,a simple form is the central computer such as in a bank or credit card company with which thousands of terminals communicate to submit transactions
0,while this system is in some sense distributed it is not really decentralized
0,most of the work is done by the central computer which is not dependent on the terminals for its own functioning
0,however responsibilities can be more evenly apportioned between computers
0,distributed computing is particularly suited to applications that require extensive computing resources and that may need to be scaled smoothly enlarged to accommodate increasing needs
0,examples might include large databases intensive scientific computing and cryptography
0,a particularly interesting example is seti which invites computer users to install a special screen saver that runs a distributed process during the computer s idle time
0,the process analyzes radio telescope data for correlations that might indicate receipt of signals from an extraterrestrial intelligence
0,besides being able to marshal very large amounts of computing power distributed systems offer improved fault tolerance
0,because the system is decentralized if a particular computer fails its processes can be replaced by ones running on other machines
0,replication copying of data across a widely dispersed network can also provide improved data recovery in the event of a disaster
0,the operation of the internet requires that each participating computer have a unique address to which data packets can be routed
0,the domain name system dns provides alphabetical equivalents to the numeric ip addresses giving the now familiar looking web addresses urls e mail addresses and so on
0,the system uses a set of top level domains to categorize these names
0,one set of domains is based on the nature of the sites involved including
0,com commercial corporate
0,edu educational institutions
0,gov government
0,mil military
0,org nonprofit organizations
0,int international organizations
0,net network service providers and so on
0,the other set of top level domains is based on the geographical location of the site
0,for example
0,au australia
0,fr france and
0,ca canada
0,while the united states has the
0,us domain it is generally omitted in practice because the internet was developed in the united states
0,the document object model dom is a way to represent a web document as an object that can be manipulated using code in a scripting language
0,the dom was created by the world wide web consortium w3c as a way to standardize methods of manipulating web pages at a time when different browsers used different access models
0,the full specification is divided into four levels 0 through 3
0,by 2005 most domspecifications were supported by the major web browsers
0,using dom a programmer can navigate through the hierarchical structure of a document following links or descending into forms and user interface objects
0,with dom one can also add html or xml elements as well as load save or format documents
0,dsl digital subscriber line is one of the two most prevalent forms of high speed wired access to the internet
0,dsl can operate over regular phone lines sometimes called pots or plain old telephone service
0,dsl takes advantage of the fact that existing phone lines can carry frequencies far beyond the narrow band used for voice telephony
0,when installing dsl the phone company must evaluate the quality of existing lines to determine how many frequency bands are usable and thus how much data can be transmitted
0,further because the higher the frequency the shorter the distance the signal can travel the available bandwidth drops as one gets farther from the central office or a local dsl access multiplexer dslam
0,a digital video recorder dvr records digital television broadcasts and stores them on a disk
0,dvrs first appeared as commercial products in 1999 in replay tv and tivo the latter becoming the most successful player in the field
0,a dvr works with digital signals and discs rather than tape used by the video cassette recorders vcrs that had become popular starting in the 1980s
0,the digital recorder has several advantages over tape much larger capacity limited only by hard drive size instant random access to any recorded programming without having to go forward or backward through a tape the ability to time shift within a live broadcast including pausing and instant replay the ability to skip over commercials digital special effects
0,the c programming language was developed in the early 1970s by dennis ritchie who based it on the earlier languages bcpl and b
0,c was first used on dec pdp 11 computers running the newly developed unix operating system where the language provided a high level alternative to the use of pdp assembly language for development of the many utilities that give unix its flexibility
0,since the 1980s c and its descendent c have become the most widely used programming languages
0,introduced in 2002 c pronounced c sharp is a programming language similar to c and java but simplified in several respects and tailored for use with microsoft s latest programming platform
0,c is a general purpose language and is thoroughly objectoriented all functions must be declared as members of a class or struct and even fundamental data types are derived from the system
0,object class
0,compared with c c is stricter about the use and conversion of data types not allowing most implicit conversions such as from an enumeration type to the corresponding integer see data structures
0,unlike c c does not permit multiple inheritance where a type can be derived from two or more base types thereby avoiding an added layer of complexity in class relationships in large software projects
0,however a similar effect can be obtained by declaring multiple interfaces or specified ways of accessing the same class
0,unlike java but like c c includes pointers and a safer version called delegates enumerations enum types structs treated as lightweight classes and overloading multiple definitions for operators
0,the latest version of the language c 3
0,0 introduced in 2007 provides additional features for list processing and functional programming
0,the c language was designed by bjarne stroustrup at at t s bell labs in murray hill new jersey starting in 1979
0,by that time the c language had become well established as a powerful tool for systems programming
0,however stroustrup and others believed that c s limited data structures and function mechanism were proving inadequate to express the relationships found in increasingly large software packages involving many objects with complex relationships
0,during the late 1980s and 1990s c became a very popular language for a variety of applications ranging from systems programming to business applications and games
0,the growth of the language coincided with the development of more powerful desktop computers and the release of inexpensive easy to use but powerful development environments from microsoft borland and others
0,since these compilers could also handle traditional c code programmers could port existing code and use the object oriented techniques of c as they mastered them
0,by the late 1990s however c although still dominant in many areas was being challenged by java a language that simplified some of the more complex features of c and that was designed 68
0,
0,c particularly for writing software to run on web servers and browsers
0,for an alternative approach to creating a somewhat more streamlined c type language
0,a basic problem in computer design is how to optimize the fetching of instructions or data so that it will be ready when the processor cpu needs it
0,one common solution is to use a cache
0,a cache is an area of relatively fast access memory into which data can be stored in anticipation of its being needed for processing
0,caches are used mainly in two contexts the processor cache and the disk cache
0,the use of a processor cache is advantageous because instructions and data can be fetched more quickly from the cache static memory chips next to or within the cpu than they can be retrieved from the main memory usually dynamic ram
0,an algorithm analyzes the instructions currently being executed by the processor and tries to anticipate what instructions and data are likely to be needed in the near future
0,for example if the instructions call for a possible branch to one of two sets of instructions the cache will load the set that has been used most often or most recently
0,since many programs loop over and over again through the same instructions until some condition is met the cache s prediction will be right most of the time
0,a disk cache uses the same general principle as a processor cache
0,here however it is ram either a part of main memory or separate memory on the disk drive that is the faster medium and the disk drive itself that is slower
0,when an application starts to request data from the disk the cache reads one or more complete blocks or sectors of data from the disk rather than just the data record being requested
0,then if the application continues to request sequential data records these can be read from the high speed memory on the cache rather than from the disk drive
0,it follows that disk caching is most effective when an application for example loads a database file that is stored sequentially on the disk
0,caching techniques can be used in other ways
0,for example most web browsers are set to store recently read pages on disk so that if the user directs the browser to go back to such a page it can be read from disk rather than having to be retransmitted over the internet generally a slower process
0,web servers and isps such as cable services can also cache popular pages so they can be served up quickly
0,the final stage in the development of the calculator would be characterized by the use of electronics to replace mechanical or electromechanical action
0,the use of logic 70
0,
0,calculatorcircuits to perform calculations electronically was first seen in the giant computers of the late 1940s but this was obviously impractical for desktop office use
0,by the late 1960s however transistorized calculators comparable in size to mechanical desktop calculators came into use
0,by the 1970s the use of integrated circuits made it possible to shrink the calculator down to palm size and smaller
0,these calculators use a microprocessor with a set of microinstructions that enable them to perform a repertoire of operations ranging from basic arithmetic to trigonometric statistical or business related function
0,development of automotive technology has tended to be incremental rather than revolutionary
0,the core hardware such as the engine and drive train has changed little over several decades other than the replacement of carburetors with fuel injection systems and some improvements in areas such as brake design
0,on the other hand there have been significant improvements in safety features such as seat belts air bags and improved crash absorption barriers
0,in recent years however the incorporation of computers in automobile design has led to a number of significant advances in areas such as fuel efficiency traction stability crash response and driver information and navigation
0,put simply cars are becoming smarter and are making driving easier and safer
0,much future progress in car computing will depend on creating integrated networking between vehicles and the road
0,an advanced navigation system could take advantage of real time information being transmitted by the surrounding vehicles
0,for example a stalled car would transmit warning messages to other drivers about the impending obstacle
0,vehicles that sense an oil slick ice or other road hazard could also mark the location so it can be avoided by subsequent drivers
0,data about the speed and spacing of traffic could provide real time information about traffic jams possibly routing vehicles into alternative lanes or other roads to reduce congestion and travel time
0,smart cars are vehicles equipped with advanced computing and communication technologies that enable them to collect analyze and share data to provide a wide range of features and services
0,these technologies include advanced driver assistance systems adas smart cars are equipped with a variety of sensors and cameras that enable adas features such as lane departure warning automatic emergency braking adaptive cruise control and blind spot monitoring
0,these features use computer algorithms to analyze data from the sensors and provide alerts or take action to prevent accidents
0,connectivity smart cars are connected to the internet and other vehicles enabling them to share data about traffic conditions road hazards and weather conditions
0,this connectivity also allows for over the air software updates remote diagnostics and other services
0,infotainment smart cars offer advanced infotainment systems that provide features such as internet connectivity voice commands music streaming and navigation
0,these systems are often integrated with the vehicle s adas features to provide real time information and alerts
0,self driving some smart cars are capable of autonomous driving using a combination of sensors cameras and computer algorithms to navigate roads without human intervention
0,these cars are still in development and are not yet widely available
0,energy efficiency smart cars often use advanced technologies such as regenerative braking stop start systems and aerodynamic designs to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions
0,during the late 1950s and 1960s software rapidly grew more complex especially operating system software and large business applications
0,with the typical program consisting of many components being developed by different programmers it became difficult both to see the big picture and to maintain consistent procedures for transferring data from one program module to another
0,as computer scientists worked to develop sounder principles it also occurred to them that the power of the computer to automate procedures could be used to create tools for facilitating program design and managing the resulting complexity
0,case or computer aided software engineering is a catchall phrase that covers a variety of such tools involved with all phases of development
0,the earliest design tool was the flowchart often drawn with the aid of a template that could be used to trace the symbols on paper
0,with its symbols for the flow of execution through branching and looping the flowchart provides a good tool for visualizing how a program is intended to work
0,however large and complex programs often result in a sea of flowcharts that are hard to relate to one another and to the program as a whole
0,starting in the 1960s the creation of programs for manipulating flow symbols made it easier both to design flowcharts and to visualize them in varying levels of detail
0,once a program has been designed and implementation is under way case tools can help the programmers maintain consistency across their various modules
0,one such tool now rather venerable is the data dictionary which is a database whose records contain information about the definition of data items and a list of program components that use each item
0,when the definition of a data item is changed the data dictionary can provide a list of affected components
0,database technology is also applied to software design in the creation of a database of objects within a particular program which can be used to provide more extensive information during debugging
0,analysis tools are computer software or web applications that are used to analyze data identify patterns and draw insights from large and complex datasets
0,these tools are used by analysts researchers and data scientists to process and interpret data in order to make informed decisions and predictions
0,some popular analysis tools include statistical analysis software these tools are used to perform statistical analysis on data such as hypothesis testing regression analysis and clustering
0,examples include r sas and spss
0,data visualization software these tools are used to create charts graphs and other visual representations of data in order to help users understand and communicate data insights
0,examples include tableau power bi and qlikview
0,business intelligence software these tools are used to analyze data from various sources such as sales data customer data and financial data in order to make informed business decisions
0,examples include sap businessobjects ibm cognos and oracle business intelligence
0,machine learning software these tools are used to train and deploy machine learning models in order to make predictions and automate decision making
0,examples include tensorflow scikit learn and keras
0,big data tools these tools are used to process and analyze large and complex datasets such as those generated by social media sensors and iot devices
0,examples include apache hadoop spark and cassandra
0,in the late 1990s a new consumer technology enabled users to create their own cds with data or audio tracks
0,the cheapest kind cd r compact disk recordable uses a layer of a dyed material and a thin gold layer to reflect the laser beam
0,data is recorded by a laser beam hitting the dye layer in precise locations and marking it in one of several ways depending on technology
0,the lengths of marked striped track and unmarked track together encode the data
0,the dvd alternatively digital video disc or digital versatile disc is similar to a cd but uses laser light with a shorter wavelength
0,this means that the size of the pits and lands will be considerably smaller which in turns means that much more data can be stored on the same size disk
0,a dvd disk typically stores up to 4
0,7 gb of data equivalent to about six cds
0,this capacity can be doubled by using both sides of the disk
0,the high capacity of dvd roms and their recordable equivalent dvd rams makes them useful for storing feature length movies or videos very large games and multimedia programs or large illustrated encyclopedias
0,the development of high definition television hdtv standards spurred the introduction of higher capacity dvd formats
0,the competition between sony s blu ray and hd dvd backed by toshiba and microsoft among others was resolved by 2008 in favor of the former
0,bluray offers high capacity 25gb for single layer discs 50gb for dual layer
0,cellular automata theory has been applied to a variety of fields that deal with the complex interrelationships of components including biology microbe growth and population dynamics in general ecology including forestry and animal behavior such as the flight of birds
0,the cues that a bird identifies in its neighbors are like the input conditions for a cell in a cellular automaton
0,the output would be the bird s flight behavior
0,the ability of cellular automatons to generate a rich complexity from simple components and rules mimics the development of life from simple components and thus cellular automation is an important tool in the creation and study of artificial life
0,this can be furthered by combining a set of cellular automation rules with a geneticalgorithm including a mechanism for inheritance of characteristics
0,cellular automation principles can also be applied to engineering in areas such as pattern or image recognition
0,governments have always to varying degrees concerned themselves with the content of public media
0,the growing use of the internet for expressive activities has prompted authoritarian governments such as that of china to attempt to block objectionable material both through filtering techniques and through pressure on service providers
0,further users identified as creators of banned content may be subjected to prosecution
0,however because of the internet s decentralized structure and the ability of users to operate relatively anonymously internet censorship tends to be only partially effective
0,in the democratic west internet censorship generally applies to only a few forms of content
0,attempts to criminalize the online provision of pornography to minors in the 1996 communications decency act have generally been overturned by the courts as excessively infringing on the right of adults to access such content
0,however a succession of bills seeking to require schools and libraries to install web filtering software culminated in the children s internet protection act which was upheld by the u s supreme court in 2003
0,by itself a web page coded in html is simply a static display that does not interact with the user other than for the selection of links
0,see html dhtml and xhtm
0,many web services including online databases and e commerce transactions require that the user be able to interact with the server
0,for example an online shopper may need to browse or search a catalog of cd titles select one or more for purchase and then complete the transaction by providing credit card and other information
0,these functions are provided by gateway programs on the server that can access databases or other facilities
0,one way to provide interaction with and through a web page is to use the cgi common gateway interface
0,cgi is a facility that allows web browsers and other client programs to link to and run programs stored on a web site
0,the stored programs called scripts can be written in various languages such as javascript or php and placed in a cgi bin folder on the web server
0,the cgi script is referenced by an html hyperlink on the web page such as a href
0,myserver
0,com cgi bin myscript myscript a
0,while the attention of the first computer designers focused mainly on numeric calculations it was clear that much of the data that business people and others would want to manipulate with the new machines would be textual in nature
0,billing records for example would have to include customer names and addresses not just balance totals
0,the natural representation of data in a computer is as a series of two state binary values interpreted as binary numbers
0,the solution for representing text letters of the alphabet punctuation marks and other special symbols is to assign a numeric value to each text symbol
0,the result is a character code such as ascii american standard code for information interchange which is the scheme used most widely today
0,another system ebcdic extended binary coded decimal interchange code was used during the heyday of ibm mainframes but is seldom used today
0,sophisticated string processing such as parsing and pattern matching tends to be awkward to express in traditional number oriented programming languages
0,several languages have been designed especially for manipulating textual data
0,snobol designed in the early 1960s is best 82
0,
0,characters and stringsknown for its sophisticated pattern matching and pattern processing capabilities
0,a similar language icon is widely used for specialized string processing tasks today
0,many programmers working with textual data in the unix environment have found that the awk and perl languages are easier to use than c for extracting and manipulating data fields
0,see awk and perl
0,many pc users have become acquainted with chatting through participating in chat rooms operated by online services such as america online aol
0,a chat room is a virtual space in which people meet either to socialize generally or to discuss particular topics
0,at their best chat rooms can develop into true communities whose participants develop long term friendships and provide one another with information and emotional support
0,however the essentially anonymous character of chat where participants often use handles rather than real names that facilitates freedom of expression can also provide a cover for mischief or even crime
0,chat rooms have acquired a rather lurid reputation in the eyes of the general public
0,there has been considerable public concern about children becoming involved in inappropriate sexual conversation
0,this has been fueled by media stories sometimes exaggerated about children being recruited into face toface meetings with pedophiles
0,aol and other online services have tried to reduce such activity by restricting online sex chat to adults but there is no reliable mechanism for a service to verify its user s age
0,a chat room can also be supervised by a host or moderator who tries to prevent flaming insults or other behavior that the online service considers to be inappropriate
0,for people who find commercial online services to be too expensive or confining there are alternatives available for just the cost of an internet connection
0,the popular internet relay chat irc was developed in finland by jarkko oikarinen in the late 1980s
0,using one of the freely available client programs users connect to an irc server which in turn is connected to one of dozens of irc networks
0,users can create their own chat rooms called channels
0,there are thousands of irc channels with participants all over the world
0,to participate a user simply joins a channel and sees all messages currently being posted by other users of the channel
0,in turn the user s messages are posted for all to see
0,while irc uses only text there are now enhanced chat systems often written in java to work with a web browser that add graphics and other features
0,there are many other technologies that can be used for conversing via the internet
0,some chat services such as cu seeme enable participants to transmit their images
0,voice can also be transmitted over an internet connection
0,for a very pervasive form of ad hoc textual communication see texting and instant messaging
0,the famous turing test proposes that if a human is unable to reliably distinguish messages from a computer from those of another person the computer program involved can at least be provisionally declared to be intelligent
0,the advent of textual communication via the internet has afforded a variety of ways to attempt to meet this challenge
0,programs that mimic human conversational styles have come to be known as chatterbots
0,the prototypical chatterbot was eliza developed by joseph weizenbaum in the mid 1960s
0,eliza mimicked a form of nondirective psychotherapy in which the therapist echoes or plays off of the client s statements as a form of gentle encouragement and validation
0,thus if one types my father didn t really like me eliza might reply tell me more about your father
0,although primitive eliza once inadvertently fooled an executive into thinking he was exchanging messages with weizenbaum
0,other classic chatterbots include parry designed to mimic a paranoid and the story generating racter
0,with simple rules but endless permutations chess has fascinated millions of players for hundreds of years
0,when mechanical automatons became fashionable in the 18th century onlookers were intrigued by the turk a chessplaying automaton
0,while the turk was eventually shown to be a hoax a human player was hidden inside the development of the electronic digital computer in the mid 20th century provided the opportunity to create a true automatic chess player
0,in 1950 claude shannon outlined the two basic strategies that would be used by future chess playing programs
0,the brute force strategy would examine the possible moves for the computer chess player the possible replies of the opponent to each move the possible next moves by the computer and so on for as many half moves or plies as possible
0,the moves would be evaluated by a minimax algorithm that would find the move that best improves the computer s position despite the opponent s best play
0,the earliest computer chess theorists such as claude shannon and alan turing saw the game as one potential way to demonstrate true machine intelligence
0,ironically by the time computers had truly mastered chess the artificial intelligence ai community had concluded that mastering the game was largely irrelevant to their goals
0,ai pioneers herbert simon and john mccarthy have referred to chess as the drosophila of ai
0,by this they mean that like the ubiquitous fruit flies in genetics research chess became an easy way to measure computer prowess
0,but what was it measuring
0,the dominant brute force approach was more a measure of computing power than the application of such ai techniques as pattern recognition
0,there is however still some interest in writing chess programs that think more like a human player
0,in recent years there has been some interest in programming computers to play the asian board game go where positional and structural elements play a greater role than in chess
0,however even the latest generation of go programs seem to be relying more on a statistical approach than a deep conceptual analysis
0,in personal computers a chipset is a group of integrated circuits that together perform a particular function
0,system purchasers generally think in terms of the processor itself such as a pentium iii pentium iv or competitive chips from amd or cyrix
0,however they are really buying a system chipset that includes the microprocessor itself and often a memory cache which may be part of the microprocessor or a separate chip see cache as well as the chips that control the memory bus which connects the processor to the main memory on the motherboard see bus
0,the overall performance of the system depends not just on the processor s architecture including data width instruction set and use of instruction pipelines but also on the type and size of the cache memory the memory bus rdram or rambus and sdram and the speed with which the processor can move data to and from memory
0,in addition to the system chipset other chipsets on the motherboard are used to support functions such as graphics the agp or advanced graphics port for example drive connection eide controller communication with external devices and connections to expansion cards the pci bus
0,in the telecommunications industry the last mile refers to the connections and equipment that actually bring content to users homes and businesses
0,one source of cisco s continued growth in the 2000 decade is the way it has addressed the consumer sector through strategic acquisitions
0,in 2003 cisco acquired linksys maker of home internet routers and wireless access points
0,in 2005 scientific atlanta maker of cable modems digital cable boxes and other consumer equipment also became a cisco company
0,the company has also entered the area of internet telephony by teaming up with skype to build a cordless phone that can connect to a computer to make phone calls over the internet
0,moving from hardware into software cisco in 2007 purchased utah street networks a san francisco based maker of software to link online communities and operator of the tribe
0,net web site
0,around the same time cisco made a much larger buy acquiring webex maker of online collaboration software for 3
0,2 billion
0,in 2007 cisco had revenue of 35 billion with more than 63 000 employees
0,a class is a data type that combines both a data structure and methods for manipulating the data
0,for example a string class might consist of an array to hold the characters in the string and methods to compare strings combine strings or extract portions of a string
0,as with other data types once a class is declared objects sometimes called instances of the class can be created and used
0,this way of structuring programs is called object oriented programming because the class object is the basic building block
0,object oriented programming and classes provide several advantages over traditional block structured languages
0,in a traditional basic or even pascal program there is no particular connection between the data structure and the procedures or functions that manipulate it
0,in a large program one programmer might change the data structure without alerting other programmers whose code assumes the original structure
0,on the other hand someone might write a procedure that directly manipulates the internal data rather than using the methods already provided
0,either transgression can lead to hard to find bugs
0,it is often more efficient to have a large relatively expensive computer provide an application or service to users on many smaller inexpensive computers that are linked to it by a network connection
0,the term server can apply to both the application providing the service and the machine running it
0,the program or machine that receives the service is called the client
0,a familiar example is browsing the web
0,the user runs a web browser which is a client program
0,the browser connects to the web server that hosts the desired web site
0,another example is a corporate server that runs a database
0,users client programs connect to the database over a local area network lan
0,many retail transactions are also handled using a client server arrangement
0,thus when a travel or theater booking agent sells a ticket the agent s client program running on a pc or terminal connects to the server containing the database that keeps track of what seats are available
0,there are several advantages to using the client server model
0,having most of the processing done by one or more servers means that these powerful and more costly machines can be used to the greatest efficiency
0,if more processing capacity is needed more servers can be brought online without having to revamp the whole system
0,users on the other hand only need pcs or terminals that are powerful enough to run the smaller client program to connect to the server
0,keeping the data in a central location helps ensure its integrity if a database is on a server transactions can be committed in an orderly way to ensure that for example the same ticket isn t sold to two people
0,a client server model also offers flexibility to users
0,any client program that meets the standards supported by the server can be used to make a connection
0,the transfer of data within the microprocessor and between the microprocessor and memory must be synchronized to ensure that the data needed to execute each instruction is available when the flow of execution has reached an appropriate point
0,this synchronization is accomplished by moving data in intervals that correspond to the pulses of the system clock a quartz crystal
0,this is done by sending control signals that tell the components of the processor and memory when to send or wait for data
0,thus if the microprocessor is the heart of the computer the clock is the heart s pacemaker
0,because most devices cannot run at the same pace as the processor circuits in various parts of the motherboard create secondary control signals that run at various ratios of the actual system clock speed
0,common business oriented language was developed under the impetus of a 1959 department of defense initiative to create a common language for developing business applications that centered on the processing of data from files
0,the military after all was a business whose inventory control and accounting needs dwarfed those of all but the largest corporations
0,at the time the principal business oriented language for mainframe computers was flow matic a language developed by grace hopper s team at remingtonrand univac and limited to that company s computers
0,the first cobol compilers became available in 1960 and the american national standards institute ansi issued a standard specification for the language in 1968
0,expanded standards were issued in 1974 and 1985 cobol 74 and cobol 85 with a new standard issued in 2002
0,short for coder decoder a codec is essentially an algorithm for encoding and compressing a stream of data for transmission and then decoding and decompressing it at the receiving end
0,usually the data involved represents audio or video content
0,typically the data is being downloaded from a web site to be played on a personal computer or portable player
0,a codec is described as lossy if some of the original information is lost in the compression process
0,it then becomes a question of whether the loss in quality is perceived by the user as significant
0,a codec that preserves all the information needed to re create the original file is lossless
0,for most purposes the much greater size of the lossless version of a file is not worth the often imperceptible increase in quality or fidelity
0,a codec is usually used in connection with a container format that specifies how the encoded data is to be stored in a file
0,often a container can hold more than one data stream and even more than one kind of media such as video and audio
0,when one refers to a windows wav file for example one is actually referring to a container
0,cognitive science is the study of mental processes such as reasoning memory and the processing of perception
0,it is necessarily an interdisciplinary approach that includes fields such as psychology linguistics and neurology
0,the importance of the computer to cognitive science is that it offers a potential nonhuman model for a thinking entity
0,the attempts at artificial intelligence over the past 50 years have used the insights of cognitive science to help devise artificial means of reasoning and perception
0,at the same time the models created by computer scientists such as the neural network and marvin minsky s idea of multiple intelligent agents have in turn been applied to the study of human cognition
0,with the exception of a few experimental systems color graphics first became widely available only with the beginnings of desktop computers in the late 1970s
0,the first microcomputers were able to display only a few colors some indeed displayed only monochrome or grayscale
0,today s pc video hardware has the potential to display millions of colors though of course the human eye cannot directly distinguish colors that are too close together
0,there are several important schemes that are used to define a color space that is a range of values that can be associated with physical colors
0,one of the simplest color systems displays colors as varying intensities of red green and blue
0,this corresponds to the electronics of a standard color computer monitor which uses three electron guns that bombard red green and blue phosphors on the screen
0,a typical rgb color scheme uses 8 bits to store each of the red green and blue components for each pixel for a total of 24 bits 16 777 216 colors
0,the 32 bit color system provides the same number of colors but includes 8 bits for alpha or the level of transparency
0,the number of bits per pixel is also called the bit depth or color depth
0,cmyk stands for cyan magenta yellow and black
0,this four component color system is standard for most types of color printing since black is an ink color in printing but is simply the absence of color in video
0,one of the more difficult tasks to be performed by desktop publishing software is to properly match a given rgb screen color to the corresponding cmyk print color
0,recent versions of microsoft windows and the macintosh operating system include a cms color matching system to support color matching
0,although most color schemes now support thousands or millions of colors it would be wasteful and inefficient to use three or four bytes to store the color of each pixel in memory
0,after all any given application is likely to need only a few dozen colors
0,the solution is to set up a palette which is a table of usually 256 color values currently in use by the program
0,a palette is also sometimes called a clut or color lookup table
0,the color of each pixel can then be stored as an index to the corresponding value in the palette
0,portability is the ability to adapt software or hardware to a wide variety of platforms that is computer systems or operating systems
0,developers want their products to be portable so they can adapt to an often rapidly changing marketplace
0,a typical strategy for portability is to choose a language that is in widespread use and a compiler that is certified as meeting the ansi or other standard for the language
0,the program should be written in such a way that it makes as few assumptions as possible about hardwaredependent matters such as how data is stored in memory
0,it is also sometimes possible to use standard frameworks that provide the same functions in several different operating systems such as windows macintosh and unix
0,a compiler is a program that takes as input a program written in a source language and produces as output an equivalent program written in another target language
0,usually the input program is in a high level language such as c and the output is in assembly language for the target machine
0,compilers are useful because programming directly in low level machine instructions as had to be done with the first computers is tedious and prone to errors
0,use of assembly language helps somewhat by allowing substitution of symbols variable names for memory locations and the use of mnemonic names for operations such as add for addition rather than some binary instruction code
0,an assembler is essentially a compiler that needs to make only relatively simple translations because assembly language is still at a relatively low level
0,compilers are traditionally thought of as having a front end that analyzes the source code high level language statements and a back end that generates the appropriate low level code
0,the front end processing begins with lexical analysis
0,the compiler scans the source program looking for matches to valid tokens as defined by the language
0,a token is any word or symbol that has meaning in the language such as a keyword reserved word such as if or while
0,next the tokens are parsed or grouped according to the rules of the language
0,the result of parsing is a parse tree that resolves statements into their component parts
0,for example an assignment statement may be parsed into an identifier an assignment operator such as and a value to be assigned
0,the value in turn may be an arithmetic expression that consists of operators and operands
0,the process of code generation usually involves multiple passes that gradually substitute machine specific code and data for the information in the parse tree
0,an important consideration in modern compilers is optimization which is the process of substituting equivalent but more efficient constructs for the original output of the front end
0,for example an optimizer can replace an arithmetic expression with its value so that it need not be repeatedly calculated while the program is running
0,it can also hoist out an invariant expression from a loop so that it is calculated only once before the loop begins
0,on a larger scale optimization can also improve the communication between different parts procedures of the program
0,the compiler must attempt to prove that the change it is making in the program will never cause the program to operate incorrectly
0,it can do this for example by tracing the possible paths of execution through the program such as through branching and loops and verifying that each possible path yields the correct result
0,a compiler that is too aggressive in making assumptions can produce subtle program errors
0,many compilers allow the user to control the level of optimization and whether to optimize for speed or for compactness of program size
0,during development a compiler is often set to include special debugging code in the output
0,this code preserves potentially important information that can help the debugging facility better identify program bugs
0,after the program is working correctly it will be recompiled without the debugging code

1,netiquette is a term used to describe the proper etiquette and behavior expected from individuals when communicating and interacting with others online
1,it involves adhering to certain rules and guidelines to ensure that online communication is respectful courteous and effective
1,some examples of netiquette include using appropriate language and avoiding offensive or discriminatory language avoiding all caps and excessive use of exclamation marks as it can come across as shouting being mindful of other people s time when sending emails or messages respecting others privacy and not sharing their personal information without their consent and refraining from spamming or sending unsolicited messages
1,netiquette is important as it helps to create a positive and respectful online environment and ensures that people are able to communicate effectively and productively with each other online
1,by following netiquette guidelines individuals can also avoid misunderstandings conflicts and potentially harmful or offensive behavior
1,chuq von rospach is a well known author and speaker on the topic of netiquette network etiquette
1,in his writing he has suggested a number of guidelines for good online behavior
1,here are some of his suggestions respect others this means treating other people with respect and avoiding insults flaming or other forms of aggressive or hurtful behavior
1,be concise when posting messages online try to be brief and to the point
1,avoid rambling or going off topic
1,stay on topic when participating in online discussions try to keep your contributions relevant to the topic at hand
1,use appropriate language avoid using profanity or other offensive language and be mindful of the fact that people from different backgrounds and cultures may be reading your posts
1,be aware of privacy issues respect people s privacy by not sharing personal information about them without their consent
1,use good manners remember to say please and thank you when appropriate and avoid interrupting others
1,be forgiving people sometimes make mistakes online
1,try to be forgiving and give others the benefit of the doubt
1,overall chuq von rospach s suggestions for netiquette are designed to promote respectful constructive online communication
1,by following these guidelines we can create a more positive and productive online community
1,advocates of net neutrality argue that all internet traffic should be treated equally without discrimination or preference given to any particular website or online service
1,specifically they argue that internet service providers isps should not be allowed to block slow down or otherwise manipulate internet traffic based on the content or source of that traffic
1,here are some of the key arguments made by advocates of net neutrality protecting free speech net neutrality ensures that all voices on the internet have an equal opportunity to be heard
1,if isps are allowed to block or slow down certain websites or services this could restrict the ability of some individuals or groups to communicate online
1,promoting innovation without net neutrality isps could potentially favor their own products or services over those of their competitors
1,this could stifle innovation and limit consumer choice
1,preventing discrimination net neutrality ensures that all internet traffic is treated equally regardless of the content source or destination of that traffic
1,this prevents isps from engaging in discriminatory practices that could harm certain groups or individuals
1,supporting small businesses net neutrality ensures that small businesses have an equal opportunity to reach customers online
1,without net neutrality larger companies could potentially pay isps for faster internet access giving them an unfair advantage over smaller competitors
1,overall advocates of net neutrality argue that this principle is essential for protecting free speech promoting innovation preventing discrimination and supporting a level playing field for all online businesses and individuals
1,newsgroups emerged in the early days of the internet as a way for people to communicate and share information with each other
1,the development of newsgroups can be traced back to the 1970s when the first email systems were created
1,at that time email was used primarily by academics and researchers who used it to share information and collaborate on projects
1,in the late 1970s a new communication protocol called usenet was developed which allowed people to post and read messages in public discussion forums called newsgroups
1,usenet was decentralized meaning that anyone with an internet connection could participate in discussions and post messages in newsgroups on a wide range of topics
1,as the internet grew in popularity in the 1990s so did the number of people using newsgroups
1,at their peak there were tens of thousands of newsgroups covering a wide range of topics from politics and religion to sports and entertainment
1,some newsgroups were moderated by volunteers who ensured that discussions remained civil and on topic while others were unmoderated and often became heated and contentious
1,in the late 1990s and early 2000s the popularity of newsgroups began to wane as other forms of online communication such as social media and instant messaging emerged
1,however newsgroups continue to exist today albeit with much smaller user bases than in their heyday
1,many newsgroups have migrated to web forums or email discussion lists but the basic idea of public discussion forums where people can share information and ideas lives on
1,netnews also known as usenet is a distributed online discussion system that allows users to read and post messages in public discussion forums called newsgroups
1,each newsgroup is dedicated to a specific topic and users can browse search and participate in discussions related to that topic
1,here are the key features and structures of netnews and newsgroups hierarchy newsgroups are organized into a hierarchical structure that starts with major categories such as comp for computer related discussions sci for science related discussions soc for social discussions and rec for recreational discussions
1,each major category is further divided into subcategories that reflect more specific topics
1,message posting users can post messages to newsgroups by composing a message in their newsreader software and submitting it to a news server
1,the message is then distributed to all servers that subscribe to that particular newsgroup
1,message threading netnews uses a threading system that groups related messages together in a tree like structure
1,users can easily follow the conversation by viewing messages in the order they were posted and seeing how they relate to each other
1,subscription users can subscribe to newsgroups that interest them and their newsreader software will download all new messages in those newsgroups automatically
1,moderation some newsgroups are moderated by volunteers who review messages before they are posted to ensure they are relevant and appropriate for the newsgroup s topic
1,moderators can also remove messages that violate the group s rules
1,archives netnews messages are archived on news servers and users can search through archives to find old messages or topics of interest
1,distribution netnews messages are distributed across a network of news servers which synchronize with each other to ensure that all messages are available to all users
1,in summary netnews and newsgroups offer a decentralized distributed system for online discussion and information sharing with a hierarchical structure message threading subscriptions and archives
1,while netnews and newsgroups have been largely superseded by other online communication platforms they remain an important part of the early history of the internet and online communities
1,netnews or usenet is a distributed system for exchanging news and information in the form of messages posted to newsgroups
1,the system is decentralized meaning that there is no central server or authority that controls it
1,instead messages are distributed across a network of interconnected servers which synchronize with each other to ensure that all messages are available to all users
1,here s how the distribution and reading of netnews works posting a message users can post messages to a newsgroup by composing a message in their newsreader software and submitting it to their local news server
1,the message is then propagated to other servers that subscribe to the newsgroup until it reaches all servers in the network
1,replication and synchronization each news server stores a copy of all messages it receives and periodically synchronizes with other servers to exchange new messages and updates
1,this ensures that all servers have the same set of messages and that users can access the latest messages from any server in the network
1,reading messages users can browse newsgroups and read messages using their newsreader software
1,the software retrieves messages from their local news server and can also retrieve messages from other servers in the network if the local server does not have a copy of a particular message
1,message threading netnews uses a threading system to group related messages together in a tree like structure based on their subject and message id
1,this makes it easy for users to follow a conversation or track the evolution of a discussion over time
1,archiving messages are typically archived on news servers and can be accessed by users even after they have been removed from their local server or the server they were originally posted to
1,this allows users to search for and access older messages and discussions
1,overall the distribution and reading of netnews is based on a decentralized peer to peer system that relies on the synchronization and replication of messages across a network of servers
1,this allows users to access a wide range of topics and discussions from anywhere in the network while also ensuring that messages are distributed and stored redundantly to prevent loss or corruption
1,the idea of networks has been around for centuries as people have always sought ways to connect with each other over long distances
1,however the modern computer network as we know it today began to take shape in the mid 20th century
1,in the 1950s computers were large expensive and rare machines that were primarily used by governments large corporations and academic institutions
1,these computers were often housed in large rooms or buildings and were operated by trained technicians
1,one of the earliest computer networks was the sage semi automatic ground environment system which was developed in the late 1950s by the united states air force
1,the sage system was designed to provide early warning of potential air attacks by the soviet union
1,it used a network of interconnected computers to track incoming enemy aircraft and coordinate defensive responses
1,in the 1960s the us department of defense developed the arpanet which was the first wide area network to use packet switching
1,the arpanet was initially designed as a way for researchers at different universities and research institutions to share computing resources and collaborate on research projects
1,over the years computer networks evolved and became more sophisticated eventually leading to the creation of the world wide web in the 1990s
1,today networks are an essential part of our daily lives connecting people and devices all over the world and enabling us to access information and services instantly from almost anywhere
1,the osi open systems interconnection model is a conceptual model that describes the communication process between computing systems
1,it is composed of seven layers each of which defines a specific function in the communication process
1,the layers are physical layer this layer is responsible for transmitting raw data between devices using physical connections like cables wires or radio signals
1,it defines the electrical and physical specifications for the connection
1,data link layer this layer is responsible for transmitting data between devices on the same physical network
1,it defines how data is organized into frames for transmission and how errors are detected and corrected
1,network layer this layer is responsible for routing data between different networks
1,it determines the optimal path for data to travel and uses protocols like ip internet protocol to transmit data between networks
1,transport layer this layer provides reliable end to end communication between devices
1,it breaks down data into smaller packets for transmission and ensures that they are received correctly at the other end
1,session layer this layer establishes manages and terminates connections between devices
1,it allows applications on different devices to establish a communication session and manage the exchange of data
1,presentation layer this layer is responsible for data representation and encryption
1,it transforms data into a format that can be understood by the application layer and encrypts it for secure transmission
1,application layer this layer provides services to end users such as email file transfer and web browsing
1,it defines the protocols and formats used by applications to communicate with each other
1,the osi model is a reference model and does not specify any particular protocol or technology
1,however it provides a common framework that helps network designers and developers to understand the various functions and interactions between different layers of the network
1,nas stands for network attached storage
1,it refers to a storage device that is connected to a network and allows multiple users and devices to access and share files and data over that network

1,they are often used as a more cost effective and flexible alternative to traditional file servers which require dedicated hardware and it support
1,nas devices can range in size from small single drive units to large enterprise level systems with multiple drives and advanced features
1,a storage area network san is a dedicated high speed network that provides block level access to data storage
1,in a san storage devices such as disk arrays tape libraries and other storage appliances are connected to servers through a series of switches and or hubs
1,sans are designed to provide high speed reliable access to large amounts of data and are often used in enterprise environments where large amounts of data need to be stored and accessed by multiple servers and applications
1,sans provide centralized storage management which allows administrators to allocate storage resources to servers and applications as needed
1,sans typically use fibre channel or iscsi protocols to connect storage devices to the network
1,fibre channel is a high speed dedicated network technology that provides very low latency and high reliability
1,iscsi on the other hand is an ip based protocol that allows storage devices to be connected to the network using standard ethernet connections
1,sans can provide a number of benefits including increased performance scalability and availability of data
1,they are often used in data centers and other large scale it environments to provide high performance storage for critical applications and data
1,cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction that typically focuses on a future dystopian society dominated by advanced technology and corporate control
1,the term was first used in the 1980s to describe a type of science fiction that features a gritty urban setting high tech weaponry and a distinct anti authoritarian attitude
1,the central themes of cyberpunk often include a focus on the dangers of technology and the impact of artificial intelligence virtual reality and cybernetic enhancements on human society
1,it often explores themes of social decay economic inequality and the struggle of individuals to find their place in a complex and oppressive world
1,some well known examples of cyberpunk include william gibson s neuromancer bruce sterling s schismatrix and the movies blade runner and the matrix
1,cyberpunk has also influenced other media such as video games music and fashion
1,neuroprosthetics is a field of study that involves developing devices that can replace or restore the function of the nervous system
1,these devices are designed to interface directly with the brain spinal cord or peripheral nerves and can be used to restore movement sensation or other functions that may have been lost due to injury or disease
1,at duke university researchers have been working on developing advanced neuroprosthetics that can help people with spinal cord injuries regain movement and mobility
1,one of the key areas of focus has been on developing brain machine interfaces bmis that can translate brain activity into movement
1,in a recent study published in the journal nature medicine researchers at duke university demonstrated that a monkey with a spinal cord injury was able to regain the ability to walk with the help of a brain controlled robotic exoskeleton
1,the monkey had electrodes implanted in its brain that were able to decode signals related to movement and translate them into commands that controlled the robotic exoskeleton
1,the researchers also used a wireless connection to send feedback from the exoskeleton back to the monkey s brain which allowed it to adjust its movements in real time
1,this approach has the potential to enable people with spinal cord injuries to regain movement and independence
1,overall the research carried out at duke university and other institutions in the field of neuroprosthetics is aimed at developing new and innovative approaches to restoring function and improving the quality of life for people with neurological disorders or injuries
1,brain implants are electronic devices that are designed to interface with the brain and can be used to treat a variety of neurological disorders including parkinson s disease epilepsy and chronic pain
1,in the future it is likely that brain implants will become even more advanced and sophisticated with new features and capabilities that will enhance their effectiveness and utility
1,here are some potential future developments in brain implants improved precision one of the key challenges of brain implants is ensuring that they are precisely targeted to the specific areas of the brain that need to be treated
1,in the future it is likely that brain implants will become even more precise with the ability to target specific cells or neural circuits
1,wireless connectivity many current brain implants require wires to connect to external devices
1,in the future it is possible that brain implants will be able to communicate wirelessly which could make them less invasive and easier to use
1,better energy efficiency many current brain implants require regular battery replacements which can be invasive and inconvenient
1,in the future it is likely that brain implants will become more energy efficient potentially using novel power sources like body heat or motion
1,enhanced sensing current brain implants can detect neural activity but in the future it is possible that they will be able to sense additional signals like blood flow temperature or chemical changes in the brain
1,this could provide more detailed information about brain function and enable more precise treatment
1,integration with ai as artificial intelligence ai technologies become more advanced it is likely that brain implants will be able to integrate with these systems
1,this could allow for real time analysis of brain activity and enable more precise and effective treatment

1,integers are typically stored in memory as binary digits or bits which are either a 0 or a 1
1,the size of the integer i e the number of bits used to represent it can vary depending on the programming language and the computer architecture being used
1,in most modern computers integers are typically stored using a fixed number of bits such as 8 bits 16 bits 32 bits or 64 bits
1,the number of bits used to represent an integer determines its range of possible values
1,for example an 8 bit integer can represent values between 0 and 255 while a 32 bit integer can represent values between 2 147 483 648 and 2 147 483 647
1,when an integer is stored in memory it is typically stored as a binary representation of the integer s value using a fixed number of bits
1,the most significant bit msb represents the sign of the integer positive or negative while the remaining bits represent the magnitude of the integer
1,for example consider the 8 bit integer 23
1,in binary this value is represented as 11101001
1,the leftmost bit 1 represents the sign negative while the remaining 7 bits 1101001 represent the magnitude of the integer 23
1,when this value is stored in memory the computer will reserve 8 bits of memory and store the binary value 11101001 at the corresponding memory address
1,floating point numbers are typically stored in memory using a standardized format such as the ieee 754 standard
1,this format uses a combination of a sign bit an exponent and a mantissa to represent the value of the floating point number
1,the sign bit indicates whether the value is positive or negative
1,it is represented using a single bit with 0 indicating a positive value and 1 indicating a negative value
1,the exponent represents the power of 2 by which the mantissa should be multiplied
1,it is represented using a fixed number of bits which depends on the specific floating point format being used
1,for example in single precision floating point format which uses 32 bits the exponent is represented using 8 bits
1,the mantissa represents the significant digits of the floating point number
1,it is also represented using a fixed number of bits which depends on the specific floating point format being used
1,in single precision floating point format the mantissa is represented using 23 bits
1,to store a floating point number in memory the computer first converts the number to the standardized floating point format using the appropriate number of bits for the sign exponent and mantissa
1,the resulting binary representation is then stored in memory at a specific memory address
1,when a program needs to use the floating point number it reads the binary representation from memory converts it back to the original floating point value and performs the necessary calculations
1,in object oriented programming inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class inheriting its properties and methods
1,to illustrate this concept with an example we can use the microsoft windows dialog box
1,a dialog box is a graphical user interface element that displays information to the user and prompts them for a response
1,in microsoft windows a dialog box is implemented as a class which we can call the dialogbox class
1,now let s suppose we want to create a new type of dialog box called a colorpickerdialogbox that allows the user to pick a color
1,we can use inheritance to create this new class based on the dialogbox class
1,the colorpickerdialogbox class will inherit all the properties and methods of the dialogbox class such as the ability to display text buttons and input fields
1,however the colorpickerdialogbox class will also have its own unique properties and methods that are specific to picking colors such as a color palette and color preview box
1,by using inheritance we can avoid duplicating code and make our program more efficient and easier to maintain
1,we can also create more specialized classes that build upon existing classes making our code more modular and extensible
1,polymorphism is a concept in object oriented programming that allows different objects to be treated as if they were the same type
1,it allows code to be more flexible and reusable by allowing different objects to be used interchangeably
1,to illustrate this concept with an example let s consider a program that deals with different shapes such as circles squares and triangles
1,each shape has its own unique properties and methods such as its size color and the ability to calculate its perimeter
1,now let s suppose we want to create a method that takes a shape object as input and calculates its perimeter
1,we can use polymorphism to create a single method that works for all types of shapes rather than creating separate methods for each shape

1,selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the smallest element from the unsorted part of an array and moving it to the beginning of the array
1,the algorithm maintains two subarrays the sorted subarray which starts as empty and the unsorted subarray which starts as the entire array
1,the algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted subarray and swapping it with the first element in the unsorted subarray
1,this effectively moves the smallest element to the beginning of the array and expands the sorted subarray by one element
1,the algorithm then repeats this process for the remainder of the unsorted subarray until the entire array is sorted
1,in each step of the algorithm the smallest element in the unsorted subarray is identified and swapped with the first element in the unsorted subarray
1,after four steps the array is sorted in ascending order
1,selection sort has a time complexity of o n 2 which makes it inefficient for large arrays
1,however it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or as a building block for more complex sorting algorithms
1,bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through an array of elements and compares adjacent elements swapping them if they are in the wrong order
1,the algorithm continues to iterate through the array until no more swaps are necessary indicating that the array is sorted
1,in each step of the algorithm the current element is compared with the next element and swapped if they are in the wrong order
1,the algorithm continues to iterate through the array until no more swaps are necessary indicating that the array is sorted
1,bubble sort has a time complexity of o n 2 which makes it inefficient for large arrays
1,however it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or as a building block for more complex sorting algorithms
1,quick sort is a widely used sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer strategy to sort an array of elements
1,the algorithm works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two subarrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot
1,the pivot element is then placed between the two subarrays
1,the partitioning process is repeated recursively on each of the subarrays until the entire array is sorted
1,the two subarrays are sorted independently using quick sort
1,quick sort has a time complexity of o n log n in the average case and o n 2 in the worst case
1,however it is generally faster than other sorting algorithms for large arrays due to its efficient use of memory and cache
1,it is widely used in practice and is often the sorting algorithm of choice for many programming languages and applications
1,insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time
1,the algorithm iterates through the array and at each iteration it takes the current element and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted subarray to the left of it
1,the algorithm maintains two subarrays the sorted subarray which starts as the first element of the array and the unsorted subarray which starts as the remaining elements of the array
1,in each step of the algorithm the current element in the unsorted subarray is compared with the elements in the sorted subarray until its correct position is found
1,the elements in the sorted subarray that are greater than the current element are shifted one position to the right to make room for the current element
1,the current element is then inserted into its correct position in the sorted subarray
1,insertion sort has a time complexity of o n 2 which makes it inefficient for large arrays
1,however it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or for sorting partially sorted arrays
1,it is also an efficient algorithm for sorting small datasets or for use as a sub routine in more complex algorithms
1,in hash based sorting algorithms a hash table is used to store the elements to be sorted
1,the keys of the hash table are computed from the values of the elements using a hash function
1,the values stored in the hash table can be either the elements themselves or pointers to the elements
1,the elements are then sorted by iterating through the hash table and collecting the values in order
1,since hash tables do not maintain any order on their own the order of the elements collected from the hash table must be determined based on the order of the hash keys
1,in some cases a secondary sorting algorithm may be used to sort the values with the same hash key
1,one advantage of hash based sorting algorithms is that they can achieve linear time complexity in the average case since hash table operations such as insertion and lookup can be performed in constant time on average
1,however the worst case time complexity is typically higher than other sorting algorithms since collisions in the hash table can lead to slower performance

1,in computing colors are typically represented using combinations of red green and blue rgb values
1,each pixel on a computer screen is made up of three small subpixels one red one green and one blue and the intensity of each subpixel determines the overall color of the pixel
1,the rgb color model is based on the additive color theory which states that by adding different intensities of red green and blue light together all colors can be created
1,the values for each color component are typically represented as numbers ranging from 0 to 255 with 0 indicating no intensity and 255 indicating full intensity
1,in addition to the rgb color model there are other color models used in computing such as cmyk cyan magenta yellow key black used in printing and the hsl hue saturation lightness and hsv hue saturation value color models used in image processing and graphic design
1,color is an important aspect of user interfaces and web design as it can affect the mood and tone of a website or application
1,different colors are associated with different emotions and can be used to create contrast highlight important information and create a sense of hierarchy and organization
1,rgb stands for red green and blue which are the primary colors of light
1,in the rgb color model colors are created by combining different intensities of red green and blue light
1,the model is based on the additive color theory which states that by adding different intensities of light together all colors can be created
1,in the rgb color model each color component is typically represented as an integer value ranging from 0 to 255 where 0 indicates no intensity and 255 indicates maximum intensity
1,by combining different values of red green and blue a total of 16
1,7 million colors can be created
1,cmyk stands for cyan magenta yellow and key black which are the primary colors used in printing
1,in the cmyk color model colors are created by combining different intensities of cyan magenta yellow and black ink
1,the cmyk color model is based on the subtractive color theory which states that by subtracting different colors from white all colors can be created
1,when all four colors are combined at their full intensity they absorb all the light and produce black
1,in the cmyk color model each color component is typically represented as a percentage value ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 indicates no ink and 100 indicates full ink coverage
1,by combining different percentages of cyan magenta yellow and black a wide range of colors can be created
1,palettes can refer to different things depending on the context but generally speaking a palette is a collection or range of colors that are used together in a particular context or design
1,in art a palette typically refers to the flat surface that a painter uses to mix and arrange colors before applying them to a canvas
1,the term palette is also used to describe the range of colors that an artist uses in a particular work or style
1,in design and computer graphics a palette can refer to a set of colors that are pre defined for a specific project or application
1,designers and developers use palettes to ensure that the colors used in a project are consistent and visually appealing
1,palettes can be created manually or generated automatically by software tools
1,probability is a measure of the likelihood that a specific event will occur
1,it is a mathematical concept that is used to describe the uncertainty or randomness of an event
1,probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1 where 0 represents an impossible event and 1 represents a certain event
1,the probability of an event occurring can be calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes
1,for example if a coin is flipped the probability of getting heads is 1 2 or 0
1,5 since there are two possible outcomes heads or tails and one of them is favorable
1,probability theory is used in a wide range of fields including statistics economics physics engineering and computer science
1,it is used to model and analyze complex systems that involve randomness or uncertainty such as weather patterns stock prices and game theory
1,a compiler is a software program that translates source code written in a programming language into machine code which is a language that computers can understand and execute
1,the process of converting source code into machine code is called compilation
1,the compiler takes the source code analyzes its syntax and structure and translates it into an equivalent program in machine code
1,the machine code is then executed by the computer s processor performing the operations specified in the source code
1,compilers are essential tools for software development as they allow programmers to write code in high level programming languages and then translate that code into machine code that can be executed on a variety of computer systems
1,this enables developers to write code that is more abstract and expressive without having to worry about the specifics of the underlying hardware
1,compilers are also used to optimize code for performance by generating machine code that is more efficient and faster than code written by humans
1,additionally compilers can detect errors and bugs in the source code during the compilation process helping to identify and fix issues before the program is run
1,there are many different compilers available for different programming languages and some languages even have multiple compilers that can be used depending on the specific needs of the programmer
1,the compilation process is the process by which a compiler translates source code written in a programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer
1,the process typically involves several stages lexical analysis the compiler reads the source code and identifies the tokens keywords identifiers operators etc
1,in the code
1,syntax analysis the compiler analyzes the structure of the code to ensure that it conforms to the syntax rules of the programming language
1,this stage involves creating an abstract syntax tree ast that represents the structure of the code
1,semantic analysis the compiler performs checks to ensure that the code is semantically correct such as checking that variables are declared before they are used and that functions are called with the correct number and type of arguments
1,code generation the compiler generates machine code that can be executed by the computer
1,this involves translating the ast into a lower level representation of the code such as assembly language or machine code
1,optimization the compiler may perform various optimizations on the generated code to improve its performance or reduce its size
1,this may involve removing redundant code reordering instructions or replacing code with more efficient alternatives
1,once the compilation process is complete the resulting machine code can be executed by the computer s processor
1,the process of compilation is typically performed by a dedicated software program called a compiler which is specific to the programming language being used
1,code generation is the process of converting the high level source code written in a programming language into low level machine code that can be executed by a computer
1,the code generation process is typically the final stage of the compilation process following lexical analysis syntax analysis and semantic analysis
1,the process of code generation can be divided into several steps intermediate representation the compiler typically converts the source code into an intermediate representation ir that is easier to analyze and optimize than the original source code
1,instruction selection the compiler selects the appropriate machine instructions to implement each operation in the ir
1,this involves mapping high level operations to the corresponding low level instructions such as adding two numbers or loading data from memory
1,register allocation the compiler assigns registers to hold intermediate values and computations
1,this involves minimizing the number of register accesses and maximizing the reuse of registers to improve performance
1,instruction scheduling the compiler reorders the instructions to optimize performance taking into account factors such as data dependencies and instruction latencies
1,code emission the compiler generates the final machine code by emitting the selected instructions and associated data
1,optimization the compiler may perform additional optimizations on the generated code to improve its performance or reduce its size
1,this may involve removing redundant code reordering instructions or replacing code with more efficient alternatives
